## Description of *M3-22 XXX* sp. nov (MAG 12)

<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;72.73
Genome contamination is ;1.48
 -->

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
its closest relatives are 
*Halomicrobium zhouii* of the Haloarculaceae family	with a similarity score of 76.42% and
*Methanofervidicoccus abyssi* of the Methanococcaceae family (76.35%). 
These scores low scores suggest a novel family however, 
genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome within the
M3-22 genus of the Nanosalinaceae family, supporting for the creation of a novel species. 
This was further supported as no valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database 
was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome. 

Based on KEGG analysis,
folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3).
A total of 13 CAZymes were identified within the genome. 
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 46.58%.
