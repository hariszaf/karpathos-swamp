## Description of ** gen. nov
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;86.45
Genome contamination is ;2.8
 -->

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
its closest relatives are members of the Methanococcaceae family; 
*Methanothermococcus okinawensis* with a similarity score of	(76.89%),
*Methanotorris formicicus* (76.89%) and
*Methanothermococcus thermolithotrophicus*	(76.10%).
These low scores suggest for the creation of a novel family however,
genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome within the
UBA9989 family
of the Nanoarchaeota, 
suggesting for a novel genus within it.
Nanoarchaeota is a phylum that has no representatives on the 
all-species Living Tree Project (LTP) that Protologger makes use of for the 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity.



## Description of ** sp. nov (MAG 131)

Etymology:


A total of 72 CAZymes were identified within the genome and
starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source. 
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 49.86%.
