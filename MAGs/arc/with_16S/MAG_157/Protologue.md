## Description of ** gen. nov 
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;90.34
Genome contamination is ;3.34
 -->

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
its closest relative is *Ignisphaera aggregans*
of the Desulfurococcaceae family with a similarity score of 78.28%.
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome within the 
TCS64 family of the Thermoproteota phylum, supporting the creation of a novel genus within it. 
POCP analysis among its genome and the members of the family, confirmed that 
as no POCP value >50% was found. 



## Description of ** sp. nov  (MAG 157)

Etymology:


Based on KEGG analysis,
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
A total of 65 CAZymes were identified within the genome.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 43.81%.
