## Descrption of ** gen. nov
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;96.26
Genome contamination is ;5.0
 -->

Etymology: 

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
its closest relative is
*Methanothermobacter thermophilus* with a score of	78.67% 
and other members of the Methanobacteriaceae family with similar low scores. 
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome within the 
AMARA-1 family of Lokiarchaeia supporting it represents a novel genus. 
POCP analysis confirmed that as no POCP value >50% was returned with any of its closest relatives.


## Descrption of ** sp. nov

Etymology: 

Based on KEGG analysis,
sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47)
and L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
A total of 264 CAZymes were identified within the genome and 
starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 41.31%.
