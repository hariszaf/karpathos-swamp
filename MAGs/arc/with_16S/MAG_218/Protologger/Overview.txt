16S rRNA gene analysis
-------------------------

The input 16S rRNA determined the isolate to be; fam. nov.
The best match was to; Methanothermobacter thermophilus--Methanobacteriaceae--X99048 (Valid) (78.67730900798176%)


Genome analysis
---------------

Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as; d__Archaea;p__Asgardarchaeota;c__Lokiarchaeia;o__CR-4;f__AMARA-1;g__;s__
GTDB-TK was unable to matched the input genome to that of a previously sequenced genome via FastANI
The genome size is; 6.29Mbp base pairs
G+C percentage is; 41.31%
Due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated.
No valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome
No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus
CRISPR arrays identified; 3
Coding sequences identified; 5525


Functional analysis
-------------------

Number of transporters; 40
Number of secretion genes; 9
Number of unique enzymes; 563
The following carbon sources were predicted to be utilised; starch
Sulfide and L-serine are predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47)
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-)


Antibiotic resistance analysis
