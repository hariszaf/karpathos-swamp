## Description of  ord. nov 
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;67.8
Genome contamination is ;1.87
 -->

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
its closest relative is
*Staphylothermus hellenicus* of the Desulfurococcaceae family with a score of 74.73%,
suggesting a nove family.
However, genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as a member of the  
Lokiarchaeia class suggesting it represents a novel order.

Based on KEGG analysis,
sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47).
A total of 203 CAZymes were identified within the genome 
while 
starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source. 
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 40.44%.
