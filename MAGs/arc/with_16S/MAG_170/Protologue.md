## Description of ** gen. nov 
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;87.85
Genome contamination is ;1.87
 -->
Etymology:


Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, its closest relative is 
*Methanothermococcus okinawensis* of the Methanococcaceae family with a score of 78.52%
suggesting it represents a novel family. 
However, 
genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome within 
DSVV01 family of Nanoarchaeota, 
a phylum with no representatives on the 
all-species Living Tree Project (LTP) that Protologger makes use of for the 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity.
POCP analysis confirmed that it is a distinct genus from the rest of the family. 


## Description of ** sp. nov (MAG 170)

Etymology:

A total of 81 CAZymes were identified within the genome and starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source. 
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 38.54%.
