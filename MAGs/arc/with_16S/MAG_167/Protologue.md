## Description of ** gen. nov 
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;97.98
Genome contamination is ;0.06
 -->

Etymology: 

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
its closest relative is 
*Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis* of the Methanomassiliicoccaceae family with a similarity score of 93.82%, 
supporting it represents a novel genus within it. 
GTDB-Tk assigned it within the 
JAAEEP01 family of the Methanomassiliicoccales order, supporting further it represents a novel genus. 
POCP analysis confirmed that as no values >50% were identified with any of its closest relatives. 



## Description of ** sp. nov (MAG 167)

Etymology:

Based on KEGG analysis
sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47).
A total of 36 CAZymes were identified within the genome. 
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is  61.61%.
