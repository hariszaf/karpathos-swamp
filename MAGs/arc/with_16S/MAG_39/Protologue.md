## Description of ** gen. nov
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;80.06
Genome contamination is ;4.21
 -->

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity,
its closest relative is
*Methanotorris formicicus*
of the Methanocaldococcaceae family with a score of 76.44%, suggesting 
it represents a novel family. 
However, 
genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed it within the
SKIA01 family of the Nanoarchaeota phylum, supporting the creation of a novel genus. 
POCP analysis confirmed that as no POCP value >50% was found with any of its relatives. 


## Description of ** sp. nov

Etymology:

Based on KEGG analysis 
folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis was predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3).
A total of 44 CAZymes were identified within the genomic DNA and starch was 
predicted to be utilised as carbon source. 
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 43.92%.
