## Description of ** fam. nov
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;73.3
Genome contamination is ;1.4
 -->

Etymology:


Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
its closest relatives are several members of 
the Methanocaldococcaceae family but with the top hit, *Methanocaldococcus infernus*, 
having a similarity score of only 74.90%. 
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome within the 
PEZQ01 order of the Nanoarchaeota phylum supporting also the creation of a novel family.
