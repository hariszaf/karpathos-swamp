## Description of *EX4484-6   NNN* sp. nov
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;97.2
Genome contamination is ;4.0
 -->
 
 Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
its closest relative is 
*Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis* of the Methanomassiliicoccaceae family
with a similarity score of 84.22% suggesting it represents a novel family.
However, genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome within the 
EX4484-6 genus of 
Thermoplasmatota, suggesting it represents a novel species within it. 

<!-- POCP analysis should be run with the genomes of the genus.  -->



Based on KEGG analysis 
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
A total of 68 CAZymes were identified and starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source. 
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 47.19%.
