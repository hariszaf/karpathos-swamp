## Description of gen. nov
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;77.1
Genome contamination is ;0.0
 -->
Etymology: 


Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity,
its closest relative is 
*Methanocaldococcus jannaschii* of the Methanocaldococcaceae family with 
a low similarity score of 74.29%. 
As MAGs 190 and 91, GTDB-Tk placed it within the
21-14-0-10-32-9 family of Nanoarchaeota,
supporting the creation of a novel genus.
To identify whether these 3 MAGs represent one or more genera, POCP values among the three MAGs were calculated. 



## Description of ** sp. nov (MAG 191)

Based on KEGG analysis
folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis was predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3).0
A total of 21 CAZymes were identified within the genome. 
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 50.66%.
