The input 16S rRNA gene is acceptable at 92.16417910447761% complete compared to its closest relative
The input 16S rRNA gene was not identified as a chimera.
WARNING: The input genome is highly contaminated (4.67%), please check the genome and be wary of the output results as they may be altered due to contamination
WARNING: The input genome is incomplete (92.52%), please check the genome and be wary of the output results as they may be altered due to missing genomic regions
Genome completeness is ;92.52
Genome contamination is ;4.67


16S rRNA gene analysis
-------------------------

The input 16S rRNA determined the isolate to be; fam. nov.
The best match was to; Methanobacterium bryantii--Methanobacteriaceae--AY196657 (Valid) (78.0%)


Genome analysis
---------------

Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as; d__Archaea;p__Asgardarchaeota;c__Lokiarchaeia;o__CR-4;f__SOKP01;g__;s__
GTDB-TK was unable to matched the input genome to that of a previously sequenced genome via FastANI
The genome size is; 5.91Mbp base pairs
G+C percentage is; 33.13%
Due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated.
No valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome
No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus
CRISPR arrays identified; 7
Coding sequences identified; 5260


Functional analysis
-------------------

Number of transporters; 39
Number of secretion genes; 8
