## Description of *M9B1D  nnnn* sp. nov
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;97.2
Genome contamination is ;0.27
 -->

Etymology:


Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
its closest relative is
*Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis* of  the Methanomassiliicoccaceae family with 
a similarity score of 82.33%, suggesting it represents a novel family. 
However,
genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as within the 
M9B1D genus of the 
Thermoplasmatota phylum, supproting for the creation of a novel species, 
as 
no valid species within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome.
A total of 55 CAZymes were identified within the genome 
and starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source. 
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 33.31%.
