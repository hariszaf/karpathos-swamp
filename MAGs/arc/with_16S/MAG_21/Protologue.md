## Description of   fam. nov
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;91.59
Genome contamination is ;0.93
 -->


Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity,
representatives from multiple families had almost the exact same similarity score, low at all cases. 
The best match was to *Thermococcus atlanticus* of the Thermococcaceae family with a score of 78.88%.
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed it within the  
Nanosalinales order of Nanohaloarchaeota supporting it represents a novel family. 
POCP analysis confirmed that it is a distinct genus from any of its closest relatives as 
no POCP values >50% were identified.
