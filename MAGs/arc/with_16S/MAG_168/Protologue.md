## Description of *PWGL01 NNNN* sp. nov (MAG 168)
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;72.66
Genome contamination is ;0.0
 -->

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
its closest relative is 
*Salarchaeum japonicum* of the Halobacteriaceae family with a similarity score of only 72.05%.
However, 
genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome within the 
PWGL01 genus of 
Nanoarchaeota, 
a phylum that has no representatives on the 
all-species Living Tree Project (LTP) that Protologger makes use of for the 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
supporting it represents a novel species, 
as 
no valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with it. 
A total of 17 CAZymes were identified within the genome. 
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 36.05%.
