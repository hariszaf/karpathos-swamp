## Description of ** gen. nov 
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;79.91
Genome contamination is ;1.4
 -->

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
its closest relative is 
*Methanofervidicoccus abyssi* of the Methanococcaceae family 
with a similarity score of 75.23%, suggesting it represents a novel family. 
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome within the 
21-14-0-10-32-9 family of Nanoarchaeota, supporting the creation of a novel genus. 
POCP analysis confirmed that as no POCP values >50% were retrieved with any of its closest relatives. 


## Description of ** sp. nov (MAG 190) 

Etymology:

Based on KEGG analysis,
folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis was predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3).
A total of 27 CAZymes were identified within the genome.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is  39.75%.
