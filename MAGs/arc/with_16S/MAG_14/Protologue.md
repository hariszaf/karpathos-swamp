## Description of ** fam. nov
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;79.91
Genome contamination is ;0.0
 -->

Etymology: 

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
its closest relative is 
*Methanofervidicoccus abyssi* of the Methanococcaceae family with a similarity score of	78.19%,
suggesting it represents a novel family.
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome within the 
Woesearchaeales order of the Nanoarchaeota family, also supporting the creation of a novel family.

## Description of ** sp. nov (MAG 14)

Etymology:

KEGG analysis predicted 
acetate production from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1),
propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1)
and folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3).
A total of 44 CAZymes were identified within the genome and starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 35.93%.
