## Description of ** gen. nov

Genome completeness is ;92.54
Genome contamination is ;0.0

Etymology:


Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
its closest relatives are several members of the Thermococcaceae family; 
*Thermococcus cleftensis* with a similarity score of 75.66%,
*Palaeococcus helgesonii* (75.64%) and
*Pyrococcus kukulkanii* (75.61%), suggesting it represents a novel family. 
However,
genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome within the SCGC-AAA252-I15 family
of Altarchaeota, 
a phylum that has no representatives on the all-species Living Tree Project (LTP).


## Description of ** sp. nov

Etymology:

Based on KEGG analysis,
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
A total of 61 CAZymes were identified within the genome while
starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source. 
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 49.94%
