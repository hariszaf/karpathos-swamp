## Description of gen. nov
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;80.37
Genome contamination is ;1.87
 -->

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
its closest relatives are members of the 
Methanoregulaceae and Methanomicrobiaceae families, with 
*Methanoregula boonei* having a top hit with a similarity score of
74.63%, suggesting it represents a novel family.
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome within the 
GCA-2688965 family of Aenigmatarchaeota, a phylum that has no representatives on 
the all-species Living Tree Project (LTP) that Protologger makes use of for the 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity.



## Description of sp. nov (MAG 155) 

Etymology:

KEGG analysis predicted
Folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3).
A total of 29 CAZymes were identified within the genome. 
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 34.21%.
