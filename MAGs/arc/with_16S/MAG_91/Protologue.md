## Description of ** gen. sp
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;77.1
Genome contamination is ;1.4
 -->

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
its closest relative is
*Methanonatronarchaeum thermophilum* of the Methanonatroarchaeaceae family 
with a score of 73.14% suggesting it represents a novel family. 
However, genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome within the 
21-14-0-10-32-9 family  
of the Nanoarchaeota phylum, supporting the creation of a novel genus.
POCP analysis confirmed that as no POCP values >50% were founf with any of its closest relatives. 


## Description of ** sp. nov

Etymology:

Based on KEGG analysis 
folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis was predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3).

The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 40.98%.
