## Description of .gen nov
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;74.77
Genome contamination is ;2.18
 -->

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity,
its closest relative is *Methanofervidicoccus abyssi*
of the Methanococcaceae family, with a similarity score of 74.00%,
suggesting it represents a novel family.
However, genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as 
a member of the UBA583 family of 
Nanoarchaeota, suggesting a novel genus within it. 
POCP analysis confirmed it represents a novel genus as no POCP values >50% were returned for any of its closest relatives. 

## Description of .sp nov

A total of 23 CAZymes were identified within the genome and 
starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source.
