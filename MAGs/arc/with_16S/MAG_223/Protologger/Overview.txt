16S rRNA gene analysis
-------------------------

The input 16S rRNA determined the isolate to be; fam. nov.
The best match was to; Methanothermobacter crinale--Methanobacteriaceae--HQ283273 (Valid) (77.11111111111111%)


Genome analysis
---------------

Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as; d__Archaea;p__Asgardarchaeota;c__Lokiarchaeia;o__CR-4;f__SOKP01;g__TEKIR-8;s__
GTDB-TK was unable to matched the input genome to that of a previously sequenced genome via FastANI
The genome size is; 5.1Mbp base pairs
G+C percentage is; 33.85%
Due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated.
No valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome
No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus
CRISPR arrays identified; 4
Coding sequences identified; 4593
