## Description of *TEKIR-8 nnnnn* sp. nov
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;90.19
Genome contamination is ;4.67
 -->

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
its closest relative is 
*Methanothermobacter crinale* 
of the Methanobacteriaceae family 
with a score of 77.11%.
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome within 
the TEKIR-8 genus of the 
Lokiarchaeia class, supporting it represents a novel species within the genus.

Based on KEGG analysis,
sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47)
and L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
A total of 121 CAZymes were identified within the genome
while starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source. 
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 33.85%.
