## Description of   (MAG 41)


Etymology: 


Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, the closest relatives are members of Balneolaceae family (89.55%), supporting for a novel genus within the family. 

GTDB-Tk assigned the strain as a member of the Balneolaceae family with no ANI values being calculated 
due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives,

However, the input genome was assigned to Fodinibius with a POCP value of 52.31%. 


KEGG analysis predicted
Biotin (vitamin B7) biosynthesis from pimeloyl-ACP/CoA (EC:2.3.1.47, 2.6.1.62, 6.3.3.3, 2.8.1.6)
and
Folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3).
Cbb3-type cytochrome C oxidase was also predicted based on the presence of sub-units I/II (ccoNO), III and IV.


A set of 158 CAZymes and 19 flagellar proteins were identified within the genome 
while starch and cellulose were predicted to be utilised as carbon sources.

The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 45.64%.
