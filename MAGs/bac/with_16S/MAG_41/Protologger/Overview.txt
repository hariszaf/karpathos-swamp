Genome analysis
---------------

Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as; d__Bacteria;p__Bacteroidota;c__Rhodothermia;o__Balneolales;f__Balneolaceae;g__;s__
GTDB-TK was unable to matched the input genome to that of a previously sequenced genome via FastANI
The genome size is; 2.71Mbp base pairs
G+C percentage is; 45.64%
Due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated.
No valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome
The input genome was assigned to Fodinibius with a POCP value of 52.31828305324965%
CRISPR arrays identified; 1
Coding sequences identified; 2380
