## Description of ** gen. nov 
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;97.73
Genome contamination is ;2.38
 -->
 
Etymology: 
 
 
Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
its closest relatives is
*Anaerohalosphaera lusitana* of the Anaerohalosphaeraceae family with a similarity score of	87.68%
suggesting the creation of a novel genus. 
POCP analysis confirmed that it represents a distinct genus as 
no values >50% were identified and *A. lusitana* had a score of 33.56%.
GTDB-Tk supported further the creation of a novel genus by placing is within the 
SG8-4 family of the Sedimentisphaerales order. 


## Description of ** sp. nov (MAG 7)

Etymology: 


KEGG analysis predicted
L-glutamate production from ammonia via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
Sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47).
A total of 599 CAZymes and 20 flagellar proteins were identified within the genome
while starch and cellulose
were predicted to be utilised as carbon sources.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 57.11%.
