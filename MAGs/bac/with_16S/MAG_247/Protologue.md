## Description of *Truepera ....* sp. nov (MAG 247)

Etyomology: 


Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, the closest relatives of it is *Truepera radiovictrix* of the Trueperaceae family with a score of	84.99%.
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as a member of the SLSQ01 genus of the 
Trueperaceae family and as 
POCP analysis returned 
a value of 50.06% with *Truepera*, the creation of a novel species was considered. 
This was confirmed as ANI identified the input genome as novel, 
with the best match being to *Truepera radiovictrix* with a value of 76.40%.

KEGG analysis predicted 
acetate production from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1) and
propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1).
The urease cluster (alpha, beta and gamma subunits) were identified within the genome (EC:3.5.1.5)
and starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source.
A total of 135 CAZymes were identified too.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 73.14%.
