## Description of  gen. nov

<!-- Genome completeness is ;75.29
Genome contamination is ;0.0 -->

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA sequence similarity, the closest relatives of the genome were found to be 
members of the Nautiliaceae family but only with a 73.89% score. 
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome under the DG-74-3 family of the Paceibacterales order
suggesting for a novel genus within this family. 
POCP analysis confirmed that the genome represents a novel genus 
as all POCP values to close relatives were below 50%.



## Description of  sp. nov (MAG 61)

Etymology:

KEGG analysis predicted Folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3)
and a total of 28 CAZymes were identified within the genome.
The ompletenss of the genome was 75.29% and the contamination 0%.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 33.24%.
