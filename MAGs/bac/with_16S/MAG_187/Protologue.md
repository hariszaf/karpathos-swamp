## Description of the *CK1056 * sp. nov (MAG_109)
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;96.85
Genome contamination is ;2.54
 -->

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
its closest relatives is
*Oceanipulchritudo coccoides* of the Puniceicoccaceae family with 
a similarity score of 90.83%, suggesting for a novel genus. 
POCP analysis confirmed that it represents a distinct genus as 
no POCP values >50% were identified. 
GTDB-Tk supported it represents a novel species by placing it within the
CK1056 genus of the Verruco-01 family
and as 
no species was identified to have a ANI value >95% with it.


KEGG analysis predicted
acetate production from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1)
and 
propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1).
Sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47)
and 
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
Folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3)
and
Cbb3-type cytochrome C oxidase was predicted based on the presence of sub-units I/II (ccoNO), III and IV.
A total of 252 CAZymes and 19 flagellar proteins were identified within the genome
while starch and cellulose
were predicted to be utilised as carbon sources.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 61.84%.
