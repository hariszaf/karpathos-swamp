## Description of Candidatus phylum

The best match was to; Rubrobacter xylanophilus--Rubrobacteraceae--CP000386 (Valid) (80.58%)
Multiple hits from a range of families had equivalent similarity scores;
*Limnochorda pilosa* of the Limnochordaceae family	(79.6%)
*Arboricoccus pini* of the Geminicoccaceae family (79.22%)
*Desertihabitans brevis* of the Propionibacteriaceae family	(78.90%) and so on. 
Moreover, the input 16S rRNA gene was determined to be 27.09% complete compared to its closest relative.
This inconsistency indicating a higher novel taxonomic group was sterngthened by the 
genome based assignment via GTDB-TK that placed the genome at the domain of Bacteria 
suggesting that the strain represents a novel phylum.


Genome completeness is ;75.86
Genome contamination is ;3.36

KEGG analysis predicted L-glutamate production from ammonia via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).

The number of CAZymes identified within the type strains genome was 87
and starch the only carbon source predicted to be utilised.

The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 68.21%.
