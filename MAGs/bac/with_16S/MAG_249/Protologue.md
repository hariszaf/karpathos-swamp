## Description of ... fam. nov
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;96.56
Genome contamination is ;4.49
 -->
Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity
its closest relative is 
*Marispirochaeta aestuarii*
of the Spirochaetaceae family, with a score of 83.37%,
suggesting it represents a novel family. 
GTDB-Tk supported the creation of a novel family by placing it 
within the  BA4802 order of the Spirochaetota phylum.


## Description of ... gen. nov

Etymology:


No POCP values >50% were identified with any of its closest relatives.

## Description of ... sp. nov (MAG 249)


Etymology:


KEGG analysis predicted 
butyrate production from butanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.19, 2.7.2.7).
Sulfide and L-serine are predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47)
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-)
A total of 182 CAZymes and 23 flagellar proteins were identified within the genome and 
starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source. 
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 46.13%.
