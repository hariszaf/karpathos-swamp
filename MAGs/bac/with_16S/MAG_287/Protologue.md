## Description of gen. nov  (MAKE SURE IT'S NOT THE SAME WITH 234)

Etymology: 


Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
its closest relatives are members of the Prolixibacteraceae and Marinilabiliaceae families of the 
Bacteroidales order, 
with 
*Puteibacter caeruleilacunae* having a top score of	86.13% suggesting for the creation of 
a novel genus as 
POCP analysis returned values <50% for all of its closest relatives. 
GTDB-Tk supported the creation of a novel genus by placing it 
within the 
GCA-2748055 family of the Bacteroidales order. 

MAGs 287, 84 and 238 had the exact same placement by GTDB-Tk meaning they could 
be represent 1, 2 or even 3 novel genera. 
To make sure of that we built trees, we got POCP among the. 
The ANI values among them are: 
MAG 287 - MAG 84: <75%
MAG 287 - MAG 234: <75%
MAG 238 - MAG 84:	77.6257
confirming they are distinct species. 

## Description of .sp nov (MAG 287) 

KEGG analysis predicted
acetate production from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1),
butyrate production from butanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.19, 2.7.2.7)
and propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1).
In addition,
sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47)
and L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
Folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3)
A total of 424 CAZymes were identified within the genome while 
starch and cellulose
were predicted to be utilised as carbon sources.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 39.64%
