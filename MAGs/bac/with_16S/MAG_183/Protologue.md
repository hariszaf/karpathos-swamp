## Description of the ** gen. nov

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity its closest relatives are members of the Desulfobacteraceae family
suggesting the isolate as a novel genus;
*Desulfatiglans anilini* being the top hit with a similarity score of 88.75%.
This was confirmed by POCP analysis which returned values of <50% for all its close relatives.
indicating the input genome represents a novel genus. 
GTDB-Tk supported the placement of it within a novel genus as 
it assigned it under the Desulfatiglandaceae family,
with no ANI calculated due to the low similarity to its closest relatives.

## Description of the ** sp. nov (MAG 183)

Etymology:


KEGG analysis predicted sulfide and L-serine are to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47)
and cobalamin (vitamin B12) biosynthesis was predicted from cobinamide (EC:2.5.1.17, 6.3.5.10, 6.2.1.10, 2.7.1.156).
A total of 104 CAZymes were identified within the genome and starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 55.08%.
