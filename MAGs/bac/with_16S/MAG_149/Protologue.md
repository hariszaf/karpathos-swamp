## Description of gen. nov 

Etymology: 

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, its closest relatives are 
members of the Thermotogaceae, Thermodesulfobacteriaceae and Synergistaceae families
but with rather low scores; 
*Thermotoga maritima* has a top hit with	a score of 79.84%.
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as a member of the
RBG-16-55-9 family of the Bipolaricaulia class.
No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus within the family. 


## Description of sp. nov (MAG_149)

Etymology: 

As MAGs 149 and 111 had the exact same assignment by GTDB-Tk
their ANI was calculated and found 86.2298 confirming they are distinct species. 
A total of 81 CAZymes were identified within the genome and 
starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 64.34%.
