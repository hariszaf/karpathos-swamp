## Description of *Spiribacter * sp. nov (MAG_107)

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, the closest relative 
is *Spiribacter roseus*--Ectothiorhodospiraceae--LT578364 (Valid) (92.23). 
In line with that, genome based taxonomy classification through GTDB-Tk assigned <our_species_name>
on the *Spiribacter* genus, too.
POCP analysis also confirmed the placement of strain in the *Spiribacter* genus with a POCP value of 78.12%

Function analysis identified the urease cluster (alpha, beta and gamma subunits) (EC:3.5.1.5).
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-)
Folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis was predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3)
and riboflavin (vitamin B2) biosynthesis predicted from GTP (EC:3.5.4.25, 3.5.4.26, 1.1.1.193, 3.1.3.104, 4.1.99.12, 2.5.1.78, 2.5.1.9, 2.7.1.26, 2.7.7.2).
A total of 128 CAZymes and 23 flagellar proteins were identified within the gneome.
The G+C content of genomic DNA is 65.52%.
