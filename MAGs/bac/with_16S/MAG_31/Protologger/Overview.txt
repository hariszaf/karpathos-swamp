The input 16S rRNA gene is acceptable at 93.4416365824308% complete compared to its closest relative
The input 16S rRNA gene was not identified as a chimera.
The input genome is of high quality and suitable for analysis
Genome completeness is ;97.8

16S rRNA gene analysis
-------------------------

The input 16S rRNA determined the isolate to be; fam. nov.
The best match was to; Deferrisoma palaeochoriense--Deltaproteobacteria incertae sedis--KM386664 (Valid) (81.45896656534954%)


Genome analysis
---------------

Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as; d__Bacteria;p__Eisenbacteria;c__;o__;f__;g__;s__
GTDB-TK was unable to matched the input genome to that of a previously sequenced genome via FastANI
The genome size is; 2.64Mbp base pairs
G+C percentage is; 66.97%
Due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated.
No valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome
No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus
CRISPR arrays identified; 0
Coding sequences identified; 2220


Functional analysis
-------------------

Number of transporters; 97
Number of secretion genes; 27
Number of unique enzymes; 534
The following carbon sources were predicted to be utilised; starch
Sulfide and L-serine are predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47)
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-)
