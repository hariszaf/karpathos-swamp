## Description of cl. nov

Etymology: 

The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity assignment method had a top hit of 81.45%.
Based on that, its closest relatives are representatives of multiple families of various phyla;
Thermoanaerobacteraceae (Firmicutes), Micrococcaceae (Actinobacteriota), Geobacteraceae (Desulfobacterota) and more. 
GTDB assignment supported its placement within a novel class as it placed it as a member of the Eisenbacteria phylum. 
Genome completeness was 97.8% and genome contamination 1.1%.

## Description of  gen. nov

Etymology: 

No POCP values >50% with any of its closest relatices were identified supporting the creation of a novel genus.

## Description of sp. nov (MAG_31)


Etymology: 

Due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated supporting the creation of a novel species. 
KEGG analysis predicted 
Sulfide and L-serine to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47)
and L-glutamate production from ammonia via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).

A total of 157 CAZymes were identified and starch was predicted to be utilised as a carbon source.

The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 66.97%.
