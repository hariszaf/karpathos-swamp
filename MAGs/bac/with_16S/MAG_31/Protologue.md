## Description of cl. nov

Etymology: 

The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity suggested *Deferrisoma palaeochoriense* as the closest relative but only with a 81.45%

GTDB assignment reached only the phylum level supporting for a novel class within the Eisenbacteria phylum. 

Genome completeness was 97.8% and genome contamination 1.1%. 

Due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated
and no POCP values >50% were identified.

KEGG analysis predicted 
Sulfide and L-serine to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47)
and L-glutamate production from ammonia via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).

A total of 157 CAZymes were identified and starch was predicted to be utilised as a carbon source.

The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 66.97%.
