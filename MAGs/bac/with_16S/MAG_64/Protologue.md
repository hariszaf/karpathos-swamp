## Description of    gen. nov

Etymology: 


Based on 16S rRNA sequence similarity,  
*Halochromatium glycolicum* of the Chromatiaceae family (92.71%)
is the closest relative of the genome supporting for a novel genus. 
POCP analysis is also suggesting to that end as no values >50% were identified.
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as under the Acidihalobacteraceae family 
and due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated.


## Description of  sp. nov (MAG 64)

Etymology: 


KEGG analysis predicted anoxygenic photosystem II from the genome (pufL, pufM)
as well as Siroheme biosynthesis from glutamate (EC:6.1.1.17, 1.2.1.70, 5.4.3.8, 4.2.1.24, 2.5.1.61, 4.2.1.75, 2.1.1.107/1.3.1.76/4.99.1.4).
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
In addition, biotin (vitamin B7) biosynthesis from pimeloyl-ACP/CoA (EC:2.3.1.47, 2.6.1.62, 6.3.3.3, 2.8.1.6),
folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3)
and riboflavin (vitamin B2) biosynthesis from GTP (EC:3.5.4.25, 3.5.4.26, 1.1.1.193, 3.1.3.104, 4.1.99.12, 2.5.1.78, 2.5.1.9, 2.7.1.26, 2.7.7.2) were predicted too. 
Cbb3-type cytochrome C oxidase was predicted based on the presence of sub-units I, II, III and IV

Functional analysis idetified 24 flagellar proteins were identified within the genome
and starch was predicted to be a carbon source.
A total of 200 CAZymes were identified too. 

The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 59.7%.
