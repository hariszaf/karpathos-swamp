## Description of *Aegiribacteria  nnn* sp. nov (MAG 33)

Etymology:


Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, the closest relatives of it are mostly members of the Peptococcaceae and the Desulfonatronaceae families but with low similarity scores; best hit is Pelobacter carbinolicus with a score of 80.47%. 
Therefore, 16S rRNA gene analysis of Protologger supports the creation of a novel family. 
However, GTDB-Tk supported the creation of a novel species within the *Aegiribacteria* genus of the Fermentibacteraceae family, where it was placed. 
As no valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome, it was confirmed that it represents a distinct species. 
As MAGs 10 and 33 were assigned by the GTDB-Tk at the exact same taxonomy, ANI values among these 3 MAGs were calculated. Their values (MAG 277 - MAG 33: 78.17, MAG 277 - MAG 102: 78.76 and MAG 33 - MAG 102: 77.2229) support that each of those represent a distinct species.

KEGG analysis predicted 
L-glutamate production from ammonia via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-)
amd Biotin (vitamin B7) biosynthesis from pimeloyl-ACP/CoA (EC:2.3.1.47, 2.6.1.62, 6.3.3.3, 2.8.1.6).
A total of 163 CAZymes were identified and 
starch was predicted to be utilised as a carbon source.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 54.49%.
