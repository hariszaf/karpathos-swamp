## Description of ** sp. nov (MAG 33)

Etymology:


MAG 33, MAG 277 and MAG 102 were all placed by GTDB-TK under the 
*Aegiribacteria* genus. 

FastANI values among those 3 genomes were 
bin.277.fa	bin.33.fa	78.1778
bin.277.fa	bin.102.fa	78.7606
bin.33.fa	bin.102.fa	77.2229
supporting for 3 different species. 



KEGG analysis predicted 
L-glutamate production from ammonia via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-)
amd Biotin (vitamin B7) biosynthesis from pimeloyl-ACP/CoA (EC:2.3.1.47, 2.6.1.62, 6.3.3.3, 2.8.1.6).

A total of 163 CAZymes were identified and 
starch was predicted to be utilised as a carbon source.


The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 54.49%.
