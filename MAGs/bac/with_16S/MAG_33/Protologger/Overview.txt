16S rRNA gene analysis
-------------------------

The input 16S rRNA determined the isolate to be; fam. nov.
The best match was to; Desulfohalotomaculum peckii--Peptococcaceae--JX861507 (Valid) (80.47493403693932%)


Genome analysis
---------------

Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as; d__Bacteria;p__Fermentibacterota;c__Fermentibacteria;o__Fermentibacterales;f__Fermentibacteraceae;g__Aegiribacteria;s__
GTDB-TK was unable to matched the input genome to that of a previously sequenced genome via FastANI
The genome size is; 3.09Mbp base pairs
G+C percentage is; 54.49%
Due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated.
No valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome
No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus
CRISPR arrays identified; 2
Coding sequences identified; 2725


Functional analysis
-------------------

Number of transporters; 100
Number of secretion genes; 24
Number of unique enzymes; 530
