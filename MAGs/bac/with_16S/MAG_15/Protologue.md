## Description of gen. nov


Etymology: 


Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, the closest relatives is
Oligosphaera ethanolica--Oligosphaeraceae--AB558581 (Valid) (87.54%)
suggesting for a novel genus under the Oligosphaeraceae family. 

Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome under the MVZH01 family of the Lentisphaeria class.

This incosistency 

No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus. 



## Description of sp. nov (MAG 15)

Etymology:

KEGG analysis predicted
sulfide and L-serine to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47).
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-) and
Biotin (vitamin B7) biosynthesis from pimeloyl-ACP/CoA (EC:2.3.1.47, 2.6.1.62, 6.3.3.3, 2.8.1.6).

Whilst 315 CAZymes were identified within the genome, only starch was suggested as a carbon source.

The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 57.16%.
