## Description of *Thiohalocapsa* sp. nov (MAG_158)

Etymology: 


Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, the closest relatives is 
*Thiohalocapsa halophila*--Chromatiaceae--AJ002796 (Valid) (98.77%)
suggesting a novel species under the *Thiohalocapsa* genus.

This was confirmed by GTDB-Tk identification as placed under the *Thiohalocapsa* genus.
ANI identified the input genome as novel, with the best match being to Thiohalocapsa_marina with a value of 79.21%.
The input genome was assigned to *Thiohalocapsa* with a POCP value of 53.75%

The KEGG analysis predicted anoxygenic photosystem II from the genome (pufL, pufM)
and 
Cbb3-type cytochrome C oxidase based on the presence of sub-units I, II, III and IV..

Siroheme biosynthesis from glutamate was predicted too (EC:6.1.1.17, 1.2.1.70, 5.4.3.8, 4.2.1.24, 2.5.1.61, 4.2.1.75, 2.1.1.107/1.3.1.76/4.99.1.4).

Acetate production from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1).
propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1),
and Folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3) were also predicted. 

Whilst 211 CAZymes were identified within the genome, only starch was suggested as a carbon source.

The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 67.61%.
