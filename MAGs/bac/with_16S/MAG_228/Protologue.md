Description of *DT-110  sp.* nov (MAG_228)


MAG 144 and MAG 224 have the exact same genome based assignment via GTDB-TK 
placing the genomes under the DT-110 genus of the Saprospiraceae family. 
No valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome
supporting for a novel species.
fastANI among those 3 MAGs though indicated for 3 novel species
as MAG 228 and MAG 224 had an ANI value of 77.6% and the rest of their combinations had ANI values <50%.


The closest relatives, based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, were inconsistent 
between MAG 224 (Pontibacter roseus) and MAG 228 (Anoxybacter fermentans) indicating different phyla; 
Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes respectively.
No 16S rRNA gene was mapped in MAG 144.



KEGG analysis predicted 
sulfide and L-serine to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47).
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-)
and Folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3).
Cbb3-type cytochrome C oxidase was also predicted based on the presence of sub-units I/II (ccoNO), III and IV.


The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 52.2%.
