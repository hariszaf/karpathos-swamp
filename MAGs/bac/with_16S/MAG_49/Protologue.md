## Description of gen. nov
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;96.12
Genome contamination is ;2.88
 -->

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity
its closest relatives are several members of the Bacillaceae family, 
with 
*Ectobacillus panaciterrae* having the highest similarity score of 79.97%, 
suggesting for a novel family. 
However, GTDB-Tk placed it within the 
SLMS01 family of the Sumerlaeota phylum 
supporting it represents a novel genus. 
POCP analysis confirmed it represents a distinct genus from all its closest relatives
as
no POCP values >50% were identified with any of them.

MAGs 93 and 70 had the exact same assignment by the GTDB-Tk. 
Their ANIs confirmed they represent distinct spcecies as they were in all paired combination <50%. 
To confirm whether they represent 1 or more genera, more tests are required. 

## Description of  sp. nov (MAG 49)

Etymology: 

Based on KEGG analysis
sulfate assimilatory reduction to sulfide was predicted via the genome (EC:2.7.7.4, 2.7.1.25, 1.8.4.8, 1.8.1.2)
and
sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47).
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
A total of 243 CAZymes were identified within the genome and  starch and dextran were predicted to be utilised as carbon sources.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 59.51%.
