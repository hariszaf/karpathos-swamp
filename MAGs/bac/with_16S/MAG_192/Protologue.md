## Description of **  nov. gen.
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;94.18
Genome contamination is ;2.38
 -->
Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA sequence similarity its closest relative is 
*Calditerricola satsumensis* of the Bacillaceae family 
with a score of 80.42%. 
POCP analysis returned no values >50% with any of its closest relatives confirming it represents a distinct genus. 
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as; SM23-32 family of the Planctomycetota phylum, 
suggesting the creation of a novel genus.

Based on GTDB-Tk MAGs 20, 110 and 125 had the exact same placement too, supporting the creation of a novel genus. 
All their paired combinations ANI values were calculated to confirm they represent distinct species; 
MAG_20 - MAG_110 : 79.00, MAG_20 - MAG_192: 76.7193 and 
all the rest of the pairs had an ANI <75%. 
POCP analysis confirmed that MAG 192 represents a distinct genus from the rest,
as all its POCP values with this set of MAGs are <50%.

## Description ** sp. nov (MAG 192)

Based on KEGG analysis, 
Sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47).
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-)
and 
riboflavin (vitamin B2) biosynthesis was predicted from GTP (EC:3.5.4.25, 3.5.4.26, 1.1.1.193, 3.1.3.104, 4.1.99.12, 2.5.1.78, 2.5.1.9, 2.7.1.26, 2.7.7.2).
A total of 330 CAZymes and 18 flagellar proteins were identified within the genome, while cellulose was predicted to be utilised as carbon source. 
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 60.55%.
