## Description of Candidatus Family name fam. nov 

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity its closest relatives are 
members of the Desulfobacteraceae and Syntrophobacteraceae families; 
with top similarity scores being ~90%,
*Desulfatiglans parachlorophenolica* (92.69%)  and 
*Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans* (88.07%). 
Genome based assignment via GTDB-Tk, placed it under the Desulfatiglandales order suggsting a novel family; 
that was supported by POCP analysis that returned values of <50% for all its closest relatives.  


## Description of ** gen. nov 

Etymology :


## Description of ** sp. nov (MAG_135)

Etymology :


KEGG analysis predicted
L-glutamate production from ammonia via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
A total of 23 flagellar proteins and 208 CAZymes were identified within the genome
while starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 59.79%.
