## Description of Candidatus Family name fam. nov 

Etymology 


The input 16S rRNA assigned the isolate as *Desulfatiglans parachlorophenolica*--Desulfobacteraceae--AB763347 (Valid) (92.69%)  
supporting for a novel genus. 

Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK however, placed the strain under the Desulfatiglandales order suggsting a novel family.

The genome completeness 98.06% while contamination was 3.01%.

## Description of ** sp. nov (MAG_135)

Etymology :


Within the genome, 208 CAZymes were identified along with the utilisation of starch.

Multiplte flagellar proteins were identified (FlhA, FlhB, FlgB, FlgC, FlgD, 
FlgE, FlgF, FlgG, FlgH, FlgI, FlgJ, FlgK, FlgL, FliC, FliD, FliE, FliF, FliG, FliK, FliM, FliN, MotA, MotB).
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).


The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 59.79%.
