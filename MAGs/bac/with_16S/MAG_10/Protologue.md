## Description of *Mesklafemicide* gen. nov

*Mesklafemicide* (Gr. neut. n. Meskla, region in Greece, L. fem. n. femicide, 
the killing of a woman or girl, in particular by a man and on account of her gender).

This taxon is named referring to a 54 years old female from Meskla Greece, who was stubbed 14 times by her boyfriend. 

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, the closest relative is Lentimicrobium saccharophilum--Lentimicrobiaceae--LC049960 (Valid). 

No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus.
GTDB-TK was unable to matched the input genome to that of a previously sequenced genome via FastANI. 



## Description of *Mesklafemicide polytimi* sp. nov  (MAG_10)

*Mesklafemicide apolytimi* (Gr. fem. adj. polytimi, precious/valuabla as life itself)

KEGG analysis identified pathways for acetate production predicted from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1),
butyrate production from butanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.19, 2.7.2.7),
propionate production predicted from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1),
sulfate assimilatory reduction to sulfide predicted via the genome (EC:2.7.7.4, 2.7.1.25, 1.8.4.8, 1.8.1.2)
and
folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3).

The G+C content of genomic DNA is 44.18%.
