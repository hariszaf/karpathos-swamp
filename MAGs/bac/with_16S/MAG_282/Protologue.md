## Description of ** gen. 

<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;100.0
Genome contamination is ;1.88
 -->
Etymology: 

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity 
its closest relatives is 
*Lentimicrobium saccharophilum* of the Lentimicrobiaceae family	(86.0%)
and representatives of several families of the Bacteroidetes phylum 
suggesting for a nove family. 
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome within
the VadinHA17 family of 
Bacteroidales suggesting it repesents a novel genus within it. 


## Description of ** sp. nov (MAG 282)

Etymology: 

KEGG analysis predicted 

Acetate production predicted from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1)
Butyrate production from butanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.19, 2.7.2.7)
Propionate production predicted from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1)
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-)
Folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3)
A total of 244 CAZymes were identified within the genome while
starch and cellulose
were predicted to be utilised as carbon sources.
The G+C conten of the genomic DNA is 41.65%.
