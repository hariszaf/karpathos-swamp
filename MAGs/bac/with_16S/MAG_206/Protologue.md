## Description of   

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, the closest relatives is
*Simkania negevensis*--Simkaniaceae--FR872582 (Valid) (88.41%) suggesting for a novel genus. 

In line with that, the genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome Simkaniaceae family 
supporting the presence of a novel genus within this family. 

No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus.


## Description of sp. nov (MAG_206)

Etymology:


KEGG analysis predicted 
Acetate production from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1) and 
Propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1).

A set of 56 CAZymes were identified within the genome.



The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 54.0%.
