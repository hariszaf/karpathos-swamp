## Description of ** nov. gen.

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, the closest relatives is
*Simkania negevensis*(88.41%) of the Simkaniaceae family, suggesting for a novel genus. 
POCP analysis confirmed the creation of a novel genus as all POCP values with its relatives were >50%.
GTDB-Tk supported the placement of the genome as a novel genus by placing it 
as a member of the Simkaniaceae family. 

## Description of sp. nov (MAG_206)

Etymology:


KEGG analysis predicted 
Acetate production from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1) and 
Propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1).
A set of 56 CAZymes were identified within the genome.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 54.0%.
