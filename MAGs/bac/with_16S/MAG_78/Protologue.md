## Description of  gen. nov 

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA sequence similarity, members of the Oligosphaeraceae family were found as the closest relatives of the genome
with a score of 85.99% suggesting its assignment as a novel family.
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK though, placed the genome under the YB12-FULL-65-16 family supporting for its assignment as 
a novel genus. 
POCP analysis confirmed that this is a novel genus as no values >50% were identified.
<!-- Both YB12-FULL-65-16 and Oligosphaeraceae are members of the Lentisphaeria class. -->

## Description of  sp. nov (MAG 78)

Etymology:

KEGG analysis predicted L-glutamate production from ammonia via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-)
and starch was predicted to be utilised as a carbon source. 
A total of 283 CAZymes were identified within the genome.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 55.4%.
