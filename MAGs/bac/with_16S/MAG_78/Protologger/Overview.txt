Genome contamination is ;4.05


16S rRNA gene analysis
-------------------------

The input 16S rRNA determined the isolate to be; fam. nov.
The best match was to; Oligosphaera ethanolica--Oligosphaeraceae--AB558581 (Valid) (85.99605522682445%)


Genome analysis
---------------

Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as; d__Bacteria;p__Verrucomicrobiota;c__Lentisphaeria;o__UBA1407;f__YB12-FULL-65-16;g__;s__
GTDB-TK was unable to matched the input genome to that of a previously sequenced genome via FastANI
The genome size is; 4.45Mbp base pairs
G+C percentage is; 55.4%
Due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated.
No valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome
No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus
CRISPR arrays identified; 1
Coding sequences identified; 3414


Functional analysis
-------------------

Number of transporters; 92
Number of secretion genes; 29
Number of unique enzymes; 633
The following carbon sources were predicted to be utilised; starch
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-)
