## Description of   gen. nov

Etymology: 

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
multiple members of the Bacillaceae family are among its closest relatives
*Desulfohalotomaculum peckii* of the Peptococcaceae family (82.31%) supporting for 
the presence of a novel family. 
GTDB-Tk supported the creation of a novel genus by placing it
as a member of the Zgenome-0027 family of the KSB1 phylum. 
No representative of that phylum is present on the 
All-Species Living Tree project version currently used by Protologger
leading to that incosistency.

## Description of   sp. nov (MAG_204)

Etymology:

KEGG analysis predicted acetate production from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1)
and butyrate production from butanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.19, 2.7.2.7).
Propionate production was predicted from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1). 
Sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47)
and L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
In addition, Folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis was predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3).
A total of 513 CAZymes were identified and 
starch, dextran, cellulose were predicted to be utilised as carbon sources.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 49.26%.
