## Description of *Dehalococcoidia bacterium UBA5760 polytimi* sp. nov  (MAG_106)


Inconsistency in taxonomic assignment was observed between the 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity and the GTDB methods. The first had the highest match to Desulfovibrio giganteus--Desulfovibrionaceae--FR749898 (Valid) (86.73%)
while the latter assigned it as a new species of the UBA5760 genus of Dehalococcoidales order. 

According to KEGG analysis, sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47). In addition, riboflavin (vitamin B2) biosynthesis from GTP (EC:3.5.4.25, 3.5.4.26, 1.1.1.193, 3.1.3.104, 4.1.99.12, 2.5.1.78, 2.5.1.9, 2.7.1.26, 2.7.7.2) was predicted. 

The G + C content of genomic DNA is 51.97%.
