## Description of ** gen. nov

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity,
among its closest relatives is 
*Dehalogenimonas lykanthroporepellens* of the Dehalococcoidaceae family	(85.31%)
but also many representatives of the Desulfovibrionaceae family with similar similarity scores.
GTDB-Tk supported the placement of it within the UBA5760 genus of the Dehalococcoidales order.
The creation of a novel genus within the UBA5760 family was supported as
no ANI values were able to be calculated due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives
and no POCP values >50% were identified.


## Description of ** sp. nov  (MAG_106)

Etymology:

According to KEGG analysis, sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47). In addition, riboflavin (vitamin B2) biosynthesis from GTP (EC:3.5.4.25, 3.5.4.26, 1.1.1.193, 3.1.3.104, 4.1.99.12, 2.5.1.78, 2.5.1.9, 2.7.1.26, 2.7.7.2) was predicted. 
The G + C content of genomic DNA is 51.97%.
