<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;73.16
Genome contamination is ;4.05
 -->
Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
among its closest relatives are 
*Sandaracinus amylolyticus* of the  Sandaracinaceae family with a similarity score of	85.66%
and *Chondromyces apiculatus* of the Polyangiaceae family with	84.26%
suggesting it represents a novel family. 
<!-- within the Polyangiales order - Myxococcota phylum  -->
GTDB-Tk supported 
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome within the 
Opitutales order supporting it represents a novel family. 
<!-- of the Verrucomicrobiota phylum. -->

## Description of ** .sp nov (MAG 263)

Etymology:


KEGG analysis predicted
sulfide and L-serine predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47).
Folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis was predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3) and
Cbb3-type cytochrome C oxidase based on the presence of sub-units I/II (ccoNO), III and IV.
A total of 97 CAZymes were identified within the genome
and starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source. 
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 63.75%.
