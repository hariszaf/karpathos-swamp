16S rRNA gene analysis
-------------------------

The input 16S rRNA determined the isolate to be; fam. nov.
The best match was to; Sandaracinus amylolyticus--Sandaracinaceae--HQ540311 (Valid) (85.66433566433567%)


Genome analysis
---------------

Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as; d__Bacteria;p__Verrucomicrobiota;c__Verrucomicrobiae;o__Opitutales;f__;g__;s__
GTDB-TK was unable to matched the input genome to that of a previously sequenced genome via FastANI
The genome size is; 2.36Mbp base pairs
G+C percentage is; 63.75%
Due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated.
No valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome
No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus
CRISPR arrays identified; 1
Coding sequences identified; 2199


Functional analysis
-------------------

Number of transporters; 68
Number of secretion genes; 10
Number of unique enzymes; 393
The following carbon sources were predicted to be utilised; starch
Sulfide and L-serine are predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47)
Folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3)
Cbb3-type cytochrome C oxidase was predicted based on the presence of sub-units I/II (ccoNO), III and IV
