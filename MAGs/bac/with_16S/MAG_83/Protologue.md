## Description of   gen. nov

Etymology: 


The species was identified as a member of the Schleiferiaceae family based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 92.09%
suggesting for a novel genus within the family. 
POCP analysis confirmed that strain represents a distinct genus as no POCP values >50% were identified.
GTDB-Tk supported the creation of a novel genus, placing the genome at the Schleiferiaceae family too,
while 
no valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome.


## Description of  sp. nov (MAG 83)

Etymology: 

KEGG analysis predicted folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3).
A total of 136 CAZymes were identified within the genome too. 

The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 48.22%.
