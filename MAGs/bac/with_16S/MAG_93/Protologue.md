## Description of  gen. nov
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;85.25
Genome contamination is ;3.91
 -->

Etymology:


Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
its closest relative is 
*Moorella thermoacetica* of the Thermoanaerobacteraceae family 
with a score of 77.02%, suggesting it represents a novel family. 
However, GTDB-Tk placed it within the 
SLMS01 family 
of the Sumerlaeota phylum suggesting it represents a novel genus. 
MAGs 49 and 70 had the exact same assignment by the GTDB-Tk. 
Their ANIs confirmed they represent distinct spcecies as they were in all paired combination <50%. 
To confirm whether they represent 1 or more genera, more tests are required. 


## Description of  sp. nov (MAG_105)

Etymology:

KEGG analysis predicted
L-glutamate production from ammonia via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
Sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47)
and
sulfate assimilatory reduction to sulfide predicted via the genome (EC:2.7.7.4, 2.7.1.25, 1.8.4.8, 1.8.1.2)
A total of 301 CAZymes were identified within the genome and 
starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 59.01%.
