## Description of *Aegiribacteria* sp. nov (MAG 277)

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
the closest relatives of it are mostly members of the 
Desulfuromonadaceae and the Desulfonatronaceae families but with low similarity scores; 
best hit is *Pelobacter carbinolicus* with a score of	80.79%. 
Therefore, 16S rRNA gene analysis of Protologger supports the creation of a novel family. 
However, 
GTDB-Tk supported the creation of a novel species within the *Aegiribacteria* genus
of the Fermentibacteraceae family,
where it was placed. 
As no valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a 
ANI value >95% with the studied genome, it was confirmed that it represents a distinct species.
As MAGs 10 and 33 were assigned by the GTDB-Tk at the exact same taxonomy, ANI values among these 3 MAGs
were calculated.
Their values (MAG 277 - MAG 33: 78.17, MAG 277 - MAG 102:	78.76 and MAG 33 - MAG 102:	77.2229)
support that each of those represent a distinct species.

KEGG analysis predicted 
L-glutamate production from ammonia via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-)
A total of 149 CAZymes were identified within the genome and starch was predicted to be utilised
as carbon source.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 58.58%.
