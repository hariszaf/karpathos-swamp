## Description of  gen. nov

Etymology: 


Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity its closest
*Puniceicoccus vermicola* of the Puniceicoccaceae family with a score of 93.60%
suggesting it represents a novel genus. 
POCP analysis confirmed that having a value of 49.82 for the case of *Puniceicoccus*.
GTDB-Tk furthere supported the creation of a novel genus by placing it within the 
Puniceicoccaceae family.


## Description of  sp. nov (MAG 63)

Etymology:


KEGG analysis predicted
acetate production from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1)
and propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1).
Sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47).
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-) and
folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis was predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3).
Cbb3-type cytochrome C oxidase was predicted based on the presence of sub-units I/II (ccoNO), III and IV.
A total of 235 CAZymes were identified within the genome 
while
starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source. 
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 65.44%.
