## Description of sp. nov  (MAG_204)

Etymology: 

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, the closest relative is *Phycisphaera mikurensis*
of the Phycisphaeraceae family (84.77%).
In line with that, genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome under the GCA-2706885 genus of the Phycisphaerales order.
Due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated supporting for the presence of a novel species.
On top of that, no POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus.

Functional analysis predicted starch to be utilised as a carbon source and
several flagellar proteins (*n* = 19) were identified within the genome.
Folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis was predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3) too. 

The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 71.41%.
