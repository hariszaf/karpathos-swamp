## Description of *Arcobacter * sp. nov (MAG_148)

According to 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity 
the closest relative is
Arcobacter halophilus--Arcobacteraceae--AF513455 (Valid) (95.78%)
with a 16S rRNA sequence being 92.48% complete compared to it, suggesting for a novel species.

GTDB-TK was unable to matched the input genome to that of a previously sequenced genome via FastANI.
ANI identified the input genome as novel, with the best match being to Arcobacter_ellisii with a value of 79.32%.
The input genome was assigned to Arcobacter with a POCP value of 64.30%.

KEGG analysis predicted acetate production from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1)
and propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1).

Several flagellar proteins were identified within the genome (*n*=21). 

Sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47).
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
Dissimilatory nitrate reduction was also predicted via conversion of nitrate into ammonia (EC:1.9.6.1, 1.7.2.2)
Folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3)

81 CAZymes were identified within the strain genome.
