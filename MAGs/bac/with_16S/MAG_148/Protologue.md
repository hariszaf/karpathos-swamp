## Description of gen. nov 

According to species 






## Description of sp. nov (MAG_148)

KEGG analysis predicted 
acetate production from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1)
and propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1).

Several flagellar proteins were identified within the genome (*n*=21). 

Sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47).
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
Dissimilatory nitrate reduction was also predicted via conversion of nitrate into ammonia (EC:1.9.6.1, 1.7.2.2)
Folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3)



81 CAZymes were identified within the strain genome.
