## Description of *Arcobacter * sp. nov (MAG_148)

According to 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity 
the closest relative is
*Arcobacter halophilus* (95.78%) suggesting for a novel species.
POCP analysis confirmed that the input genome is part of the *Arcobacter* genus 
returning a POCP value of 64.30%.
GTDB-Tk supported the creation of a novel species assigning the genome as a member of the Arcobacteraceae family
while ANI identified the input genome as novel, 
with the best match being to *Arcobacter ellisii* with a value of 79.32%.

KEGG analysis predicted acetate production from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1)
and propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1).
Several flagellar proteins were identified within the genome (*n*=21). 
Sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47).
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
Dissimilatory nitrate reduction was also predicted via conversion of nitrate into ammonia (EC:1.9.6.1, 1.7.2.2)
Folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3)
81 CAZymes were identified within the strain genome. 
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 29.07%.
