## Description of sp. nov (MAG 288)

<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;95.23
Genome contamination is ;2.27 
-->
Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, 
its closest relatives are members of the 
Phycisphaeraceae family and more specifically,
*Phycisphaera mikurensis* with a similarity score of 81.65%
and
*Algisphaera agarilytica* with 81.03%. 
GTDB-Tk suggested it represents a novel species, placing within the 
REDD01 genus of the Phycisphaerales order.
This was further supportied as
no valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% 
with it.

KEGG analysis predicted
Folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3)
A total of 154 CAZymes and 21 flagellar proteins were identified within the genome
while starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source.
