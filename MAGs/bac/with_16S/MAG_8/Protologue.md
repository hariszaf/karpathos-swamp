## Description of   ord. nov

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA sequence similarity, members of the Chromatiaceae family were predicted 
as closest relatives to the genome with a score of 81.86%. 
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome at the phylum level and more specifically at the OLB16
suggesting the genome represents a novel class. 
Due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated.
POCP analysis reported no values >50%.

Etymology:

KEGG analysis predicted acetate production from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1),
propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1)
and 
L-glutamate production from ammonia via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
Sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47).
A total of 344 CAZymes were identified and starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source.
22 flagellar proteins were identified within the genome too.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 53.6%.
<!-- Genome completeness is ;98.84
Genome contamination is ;3.85 -->
