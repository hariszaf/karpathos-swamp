Quality check
-------------

The input 16S rRNA gene is acceptable at 90.84293511218921% complete compared to its closest relative
The input 16S rRNA gene was not identified as a chimera.
WARNING: The input genome is incomplete (88.18%), please check the genome and be wary of the output results as they may be altered due to missing genomic regions
Genome completeness is ;88.18
Genome contamination is ;2.02


16S rRNA gene analysis
-------------------------

The input 16S rRNA determined the isolate to be; fam. nov.
The best match was to; Egibacter rhizosphaerae--Egibacteraceae--KR605111 (Valid) (82.15488215488216%)


Genome analysis
---------------

Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as; d__Bacteria;p__Chloroflexota;c__Anaerolineae;o__B4-G1;f__SLSP01;g__G713;s__
GTDB-TK was unable to matched the input genome to that of a previously sequenced genome via FastANI
The genome size is; 6.21Mbp base pairs
G+C percentage is; 58.11%
Due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated.
No valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome
No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus
CRISPR arrays identified; 22
Coding sequences identified; 5168


Functional analysis
-------------------

Number of transporters; 118
Number of secretion genes; 28
Number of unique enzymes; 690
The following carbon sources were predicted to be utilised; starch
Sulfide and L-serine are predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47)
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-)
