## Description of ..  gen. nov

Etymology: 

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, among its closest relatives is
*Thermomarinilinea lacunifontana* of the Anaerolineae incertae sedis family (82.08%)
Genome based assignment via GTDB-Tk placed the genome under the G713 genus of the 
Anaerolineae class of the Chloroflexota phylum suggesting for a novel genus as
no POCP values >50% were identified with any of its closest relatives.


## Description of ... sp. nov (MAG_222)

Etymology: 

KEGG analysis predicted 
sulfide and L-serine to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47).
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-) too. 
The species contains at least 326 CAZymes, however only starch was suggested as a carbon source.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 58.11%.
