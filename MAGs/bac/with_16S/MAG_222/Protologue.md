## Description of   (MAG_222)

Etymology: 

Inconsistency in taxonomic assignment between diffent methods was observed. 

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, the closest relative is
*Egibacter rhizosphaerae*--Egibacteraceae--KR605111 (Valid) (82.15%)
suggesting the presence of a novel family.

Genome based assignment via GTDB-Tk placed the genome under the G713 genus of the 
Anaerolineae class of the Chloroflexota phylum. 

The Anaerolineae class is present on the All-Species Living Tree project version currently used by Protologger.



No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus


## Description of  sp. nov (MAG_222)

Etymology: 

KEGG analysis predicted 
sulfide and L-serine to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47).
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-) too. 

The species contains at least 326 CAZymes, however only starch was suggested as a carbon source.

The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 58.11%.
