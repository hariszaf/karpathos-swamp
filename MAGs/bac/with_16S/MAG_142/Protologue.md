## Description of   (MAG 142)
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;95.75
Genome contamination is ;1.01
 -->

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
its closest relative is 
*Roseospirillum parvum* of the Rhodospirillaceae family 
with a similarity score of 86.05% suggesting a novel genus.
POCP analysis confirmed that it represents a distinct genus; a POCP value of 31.03% with *R. parvum*.
GTDB-Tk supported further the creation of a novel genus 
by placing it  within the Micavibrionaceae family. 
A set of the MAGs retrieved in our study, had the exact same placement by the GTDB-Tk
(MAGs: 142, 18, 113, 76, 276). 
To make sure these represent distinct species, the ANI score among all the paired combinations was calculated 
and all were <75%. 
POCP analysis confirmed that these MAG 142 along with MAG 18 and MAG 113. 
The [phylogeny](https://github.com/hariszaf/karpathos-swamp/blob/main/MAGs/Phylogenies/bac/f__Micavibrionaceae/investigation_bs.iqtree) of the MAGs and of representative genomes of the 
Micavibrionaceae family supported they all belong to a monophyletic group. 

## Description of sp. 

Etymology:

Based on KEGG analysis
sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47).
Folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis was predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3).
A total of 109 CAZymes and 20 flagellar proteins were identified within the genome.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 48.07%.
