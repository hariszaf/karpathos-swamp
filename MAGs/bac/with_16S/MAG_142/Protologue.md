## Description of   (MAG 76)
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;91.46
Genome contamination is ;1.3
 -->

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
its closest relative is 
*Roseospirillum parvum* of the Rhodospirillaceae family 
with a similarity score of 86.05% suggesting a novel genus.
POCP analysis confirmed that it represents a distinct genus; a POCP value of 31.03% with *R. parvum*.
GTDB-Tk supported further the creation of a novel genus 
by placing it  within the Micavibrionaceae family. 
A set of the MAGs retrieved in our study, had the exact same placement by the GTDB-Tk
(MAGs: 142, 18, 113, 76, 276). 
To make sure these represent distinct species, the ANI score among all the paired combinations was calculated 
and all were <75%. 

To investigate whether they represent 1 or multipla genera, further analysis is required. 


## Description of sp. 

Etymology:

Based on KEGG analysis
sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47).
Folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis was predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3).
A total of 109 CAZymes and 20 flagellar proteins were identified within the genome.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 48.07%.
