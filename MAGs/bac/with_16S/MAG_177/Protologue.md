## Description of the ** gen. nov

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity
the closest relatives are
members of the Hymenobacteraceae family;
*Rufibacter roseus* (84.24%)
*Rufibacter glacialis* (84.06%)
*Hymenobacter algoricola* (83.90%), 
suggesting for a novel family. 
*Flexithrix dorotheae* of the Flammeovirgaceae family, had a similar similarity score too	(84.17%). 
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK though, placed the genome as a member of the JAAYUY01 family 
and POCP analysis confirmed that the strain represents a distinct genus as all POCP values to close relatives were below 30%.

## Description of the ** sp. nov (MAG 177)

Etymology:

KEGG analysis predicted
Folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3)
and
Cbb3-type cytochrome C oxidase based on the presence of sub-units I/II (ccoNO), III and IV.
A total of 136 CAZymes were identified within the genome too. 
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 37.52%.
