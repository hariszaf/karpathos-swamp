The genome size is; 4.1Mbp base pairs
G+C percentage is; 69.44%
ANI identified the input genome as novel, with the best match being to Algisphaera_agarilytica with a value of 77.5547%
No valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome
No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus
CRISPR arrays identified; 1
Coding sequences identified; 3364
