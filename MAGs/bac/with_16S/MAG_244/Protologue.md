## Description of  gen. nov (MAG_244)

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, its closest relatives are 
*Calorithrix insularis* of the Calditrichaeota incertae sedis family (88.34%)
and 
*Rhodanobacter aciditrophus* of the Rhodanobacteraceae (88.14%)
suggesting it represents a a novel genus. 
As no POCP values >50% were identified, this was further supported. 
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed it 
within the JAABVY01 family of the Zixibacteria phylum suggesting it represents a novel genus too. 

The Calditrichaeota NCBI phylum has been associated with multiple phyla on GTDB. 
(Calditrichota, KSB1, JdFR-76, AABM5-125-24, Zixibacteria).
No representative of the Zixibacteria phylum is present on 
the All-Species Living Tree project version currently used by Protologger.

## Description of sp. nov (MAG_244)

Etymology: 


KEGG analysis predicted 
Acetate production from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1)
and Propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1).
Sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47).
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
Moreover, a total of 160 CAZymes,
as well as 23 flagellar proteins were identified within the genome 
and starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source.

The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 49.48%.
