Etymology: 


Based on 16S rRNA sequence similarity 
its closest relatives are all members of the Oscillospiraceae family, member of the Firmicutes phylum,
with 
*Acetivibrio thermocellus* having a top hit with a score of 85.70% suggesting for a novel family. 
The GTDB-Tk placed it within the
UBA11346 class of the Planctomycetota phylum. 
No metagenomic reconstructed genomes (MAGs) matching it was identified.

Etymology:


KEGG analysis predicted
acetate production from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1)
and
propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1).
Sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47)
and L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
A total of 318 CAZymes 
and 23 flagellar proteins 
were identified within the genome and starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 50.79%.
