## Description of   (MAG 76)
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;94.2
Genome contamination is ;0.58
 -->

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
its closest relative is 
*Roseospirillum parvum* of the Rhodospirillaceae family 
with a similarity score of 88.18% suggesting a novel genus.
POCP analysis confirmed that it represents a distinct genus; a POCP value of 31.88% with *R. parvum*.
GTDB-Tk supported further the creation of a novel genus 
by placing it 
within the Micavibrionaceae family. 
A set of the MAGs retrieved in our study, had the exact same placement by the GTDB-Tk
(MAGs: 142, 18, 113, 76, 276). 
To make sure these represent distinct species, the ANI score among all the paired combinations was calculated 
and all were <75%. 

To investigate whether they represent 1 or multipla genera, further analysis is required. 


## Description of sp. 

Etymology:

KEGG analysis predicted 
acetate production from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1)
and
propionate production predicted from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1).
Sulfide and L-serine are predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47)
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-)
Folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3)
A total of 92 CAZymes and 20 flagellar proteins were identified within the genome.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 46.18%.
