Genome analysis
---------------

Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as; d__Bacteria;p__Actinobacteriota;c__Acidimicrobiia;o__Acidimicrobiales;f__Ilumatobacteraceae;g__;s__
GTDB-TK was unable to matched the input genome to that of a previously sequenced genome via FastANI
The genome size is; 3.07Mbp base pairs
G+C percentage is; 71.12%
ANI identified the input genome as novel, with the best match being to Ilumatobacter_nonamiensis with a value of 78.0167%
No valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome
No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus
CRISPR arrays identified; 0
Coding sequences identified; 3163
