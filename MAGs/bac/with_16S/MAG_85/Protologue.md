## Description of gen. nov

Etymology:

The species was identified as a member of the genus *Ilumatobacter*
based on a 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity 
of 93.95% to *I. fluminis*,
93.60% to *I. nonamiensis*
and 92.80% to *I. coccineus*. 
No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus.
GTDB-Tk supported the creation of a novel genus, placing genome within the Ilumatobacteraceae family.


## Description of sp. nov (MAG 85)

Etymology:


KEGG analysis predicted 
acetate production from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1)
propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1) and
L-glutamate production from ammonia via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
A total of 126 CAZymes were identified within the genome.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 71.12%.
