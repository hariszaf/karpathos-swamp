## Description of   

The best match was to; Desulfuromonas acetoxidans--Desulfuromonadaceae--AAEW02000008 (Valid) (81.74778761061947%)

The Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome under the class of the Omnitrophota phylum. 

This inconsistency is probably because of the lack of any representative of the Omnitrophota phylum 
on the All-Species Living Tree project version currently used by Protologger.

<!-- The Omnitrophia class has currently 4 orders, 9 families, 24 genus and 52 genomes on GTDB.  -->



## (MAG_204)


KEGG analysis predicted 
Sulfide and L-serine to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47).
On top of that, 
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-)
and
Biotin (vitamin B7) biosynthesis predicted from pimeloyl-ACP/CoA (EC:2.3.1.47, 2.6.1.62, 6.3.3.3, 2.8.1.6).

22 CAZymes were identified within the strain genome
and starch was the only carbon source predicted to be utilised.

The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 47.74%.
