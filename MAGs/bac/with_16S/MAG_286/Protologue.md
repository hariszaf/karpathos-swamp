## Description of gen. nov
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;95.05
Genome contamination is ;2.2
 -->

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
a series of members of the Anaerolineaceae family (Chloroflexota) are its closest relatives;
*Anaerolinea thermophila* (88.48%), 
*Longilinea arvoryzae* (88.03%), 
*Leptolinea tardivitalis* (88.03%) suggesting a novel family.
GTDB-Tk however, 
placed it within 
Fermentibacteraceae family
of the Fermentibacterota phylum, supporting the creation of a novel genus within it. 
POCP analysis confirmed it is a distinct genus from all its closest relatives as no POCP values >50% were returned.


## Description of sp. nov

KEGG analysis predicted 
L-glutamate production from ammonia via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).

A total of 145 CAZymes were identified within the genome and
starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 66.34%.
