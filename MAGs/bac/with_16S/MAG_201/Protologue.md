## Description of Salinivenus ... sp. nov  (MAG_201)

Etymology:


Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
multiple representatives of the Salinibacteraceae family 
were found among its closest relatives, suggesting that the genome represents a novel species.
*Longibacter salinarum* had the best hit	(95.44%)
while
*Salinivenus lutea* (94.31%)
*Salinivenus iranica* (94.05%) were among the top 5. 
POCP analysis confirmed that the genome is part of the 
*Salinivenus* genus with a POCP value of 52.26%
and 
GTDB-Tk supported the creation of a novel species, placing 
the genome under the JAAAPH01 genus of the Salinibacteraceae family. 
with no ANI valuescalculated,
due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives.

KEGG analysis predicted 
propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.8.3.1)
and 
L-glutamate production from ammoniavia L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
Folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis was predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3) too.
A total of 21 flagellar proteins and 241 CAZymes were identified within the genome
and starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 65.36%.
