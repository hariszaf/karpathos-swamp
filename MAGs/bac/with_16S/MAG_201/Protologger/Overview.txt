16S rRNA gene analysis
-------------------------

The input 16S rRNA determined the isolate to be; sp. nov.
The best match was to; Longibacter salinarum--Salinibacteraceae--KU954547 (Valid) (95.44468546637745%)


Genome analysis
---------------

Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as; d__Bacteria;p__Bacteroidota;c__Rhodothermia;o__Rhodothermales;f__Salinibacteraceae;g__JAAAPH01;s__
GTDB-TK was unable to matched the input genome to that of a previously sequenced genome via FastANI
The genome size is; 4.79Mbp base pairs
G+C percentage is; 65.36%
Due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated.
No valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome
The input genome was assigned to Salinivenus with a POCP value of 52.26784947775075%
CRISPR arrays identified; 1
Coding sequences identified; 4113
