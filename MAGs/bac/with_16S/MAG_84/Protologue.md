## Description of  gen. nov

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity its closest relatives are members of the Marinilabiliaceae family; 
*Carboxylicivirga sediminis* (88.64%)
*Carboxylicivirga mesophila* (87.79%) supporting for a novel genus within the family.
POCP analysis confirmed that the strain represents a novel genus as 
no POCP values >50% were identified with any of its closest relatives.
GTDB-Tk supported the creation of a novel genus, placing the genome at the GCA-2748055 family.

## Description of  sp. nov (MAG 84)

Etymology:


KEGG analysis predicted
butyrate production from butanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.19, 2.7.2.7)
and propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.8.3.1).
Sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47)
and L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
Folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis was predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3) too, while
starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source.

The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 46.44%.
