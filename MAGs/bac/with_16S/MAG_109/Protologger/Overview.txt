16S rRNA gene analysis
-------------------------

The input 16S rRNA determined the isolate to be; fam. nov.
The best match was to; Lysobacter mobilis--Lysobacteraceae--JQ608331 (Valid) (77.15582450832072%)


Genome analysis
---------------

Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as; d__Bacteria;p__Hydrogenedentota;c__Hydrogenedentia;o__Hydrogenedentiales;f__CAITNO01;g__SLFT01;s__
GTDB-TK was unable to matched the input genome to that of a previously sequenced genome via FastANI
The genome size is; 4.9Mbp base pairs
G+C percentage is; 51.1%
Due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated.
No valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome
No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus
CRISPR arrays identified; 2
Coding sequences identified; 3856


Functional analysis
-------------------

Number of transporters; 84
Number of secretion genes; 36
Number of unique enzymes; 717
The following carbon sources were predicted to be utilised; starch, cellulose
Sulfide and L-serine are predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47)
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-)
