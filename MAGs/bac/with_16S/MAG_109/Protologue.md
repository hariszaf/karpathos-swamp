## Description of the ** gen. nov

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, its closest relatives are members of the 
Lysobacteraceae and the Geobacteraceae families
but with the top hit having a similarity score of only 77.15%, 
suggesting for a novel family.

However, GTDB-TK supported for a novel genus within the CAITNO01 family,
placing in within the SLFT01 genus.
POCP analysis confirmed 
that strain it represents a distinct genus
as all POCP values to close relatives were below 50%.




## Description of the ** sp. nov (MAG_109)

Etymology:

KEGG analysis predicted
sulfide and L-serine to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47).
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
On top of that, 392 CAZymes were identified Within the genome, while
cellulose and starch were predicted to be utilised as carbon sources.
The G+C content of genomic DNA is 51.1%.
