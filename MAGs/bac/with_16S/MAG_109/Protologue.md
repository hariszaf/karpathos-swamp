## Description of the ** sp. nov (MAG_109)


Inconsistency in taxonomic assignment was observed between methods
as the highest match based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity was
Lysobacter mobilis--Lysobacteraceae--JQ608331 (Valid) (77.1%)
while the genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome 
at the SLFT01 genus of the Hydrogenedentiales order. 
The 16S rRNA gene was determined to be 44.51 complete compared to its closest relative.

No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus.


Within the genome, 392 CAZymes were identified along with the utilisation of 
cellulose and starch.

Sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47)
and L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).

The G+C content of genomic DNA is 51.1%.
