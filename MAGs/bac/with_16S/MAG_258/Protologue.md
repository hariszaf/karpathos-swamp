## Description of  gen. nov
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;96.59
Genome contamination is ;3.51

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
its closest relatives are 
*Algisphaera agarilytica* 
and 
*Phycisphaera mikurensis*
of the Lewinellaceae family, with similarity scores of 
88.75% and 86.83% respectively. 
GTDB-Tk however, placed it within the 
Phycisphaeraceae family 
(Phycisphaerales phylum) 
suggesting it represents a novel genus. 
A set of MAGs (216, 221, 254, 258, 98, 97 and 208)
were placed by GTDB-Tk within the Phycisphaeraceae family. 
To make sure they represent distinct species, the ANI value of 
for all the pair-combinations of them was calculater:

| MAG pair| ANI value (%) |
|:------:|:---------------:|
|MAG_216 -	MAG_221 |	77.86 |
|MAG_216 -	MAG_254 |	76.80 | 
|MAG_254 -	MAG_98  |	81.83 |
|MAG_254 -	MAG_258 | 81.25 |
|MAG_254 -	MAG_208 | 76.98 |
|MAG_254 -	MAG_216 | 76.60 |
|MAG_258 -	MAG_98  |	80.50 |
|MAG_258 -	MAG_208 | 76.70 |
|MAG_98  -	MAG_208 | 76.70 |

All the rest are <75%. Therefore each of them represents a distinct species. 
To make sure whether they represent 1 or more genera, a phylogenetic tree of all of them with their 
representative members of the closest branches of the GTDB tree was built. 


## Description of sp. nov (MAG 216)

Etymology:


Based on KEGG analysis,
anoxygenic photosystem II was predicted from the genome (pufL, pufM).
Acetate production was predicted from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1)
and 
propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1).
Sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47).
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
Folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3)
and 
Riboflavin (vitamin B2) biosynthesis predicted from GTP (EC:3.5.4.25, 3.5.4.26, 1.1.1.193, 3.1.3.104, 4.1.99.12, 2.5.1.78, 2.5.1.9, 2.7.1.26, 2.7.7.2).
A total of 274 CAZymes and 19 flagellar proteins were identified within the genome
while starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 68.45%.
