## Description of   (MAG_101)

<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;89.83
Genome contamination is ;0.0
 -->

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
members of the 
multiple families, 
Halanaerobiaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, Desulfuromonadaceae and Ectothiorhodospiraceae,
of various phyla,
they all had a similarity score of ~83%.
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome within the 
Bipolaricaulia class of the Bipolaricaulota phylum.
MAGs 101, 86 and 13
were all placed by GTDB-Tk 
within the 
Bipolaricaulia class
suggesting the creation of novel orders. 
The ANI values among the indicated they are not 
reprenting the same species as 
MAG 86 - MAG 13:	79.89%
MAG 86 - MAG 101: <75%
MAG 101 - MAG 13: <75%
