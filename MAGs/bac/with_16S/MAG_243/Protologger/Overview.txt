16S rRNA gene analysis
-------------------------

The input 16S rRNA determined the isolate to be; fam. nov.
The best match was to; Thermosinus carboxydivorans--Sporomusaceae--FR749975 (Valid) (83.17757009345794%)


Genome analysis
---------------

Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as; d__Bacteria;p__FCPU426;c__JAAXVQ01;o__JAAXVQ01;f__JAAXVQ01;g__;s__
GTDB-TK was unable to matched the input genome to that of a previously sequenced genome via FastANI
The genome size is; 2.6Mbp base pairs
G+C percentage is; 66.11%
Due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated.
No valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome
No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus
CRISPR arrays identified; 2
Coding sequences identified; 2243


Functional analysis
-------------------

Number of transporters; 88
Number of secretion genes; 21
Number of unique enzymes; 508
