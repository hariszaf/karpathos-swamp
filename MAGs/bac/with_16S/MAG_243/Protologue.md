## Description of  gen. nov

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, its closest relatives 
are representatives of multiple families such as Sporomusaceae, Caryophanaceae, Thermoanaerobacteraceae and more.
The best hit is *Thermosinus carboxydivorans* of the Sporomusaceae family with a similarity score of 83.17%
suggesting the creation of a novel family.
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome under the JAAXVQ01 genus of the FCPU426 phylum. 
Due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated.
No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus.
<!-- As no representatives of the FCPU426 phylum are present on
the All-Species Living Tree project version currently used by Protologger. -->

## Description of  sp. nov (MAG_243)

Etymology:

A total of 141 CAZymes were identified and starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source.
KEGG analysis predicted 
Sulfide and L-serine to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47).
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 66.11.%.
