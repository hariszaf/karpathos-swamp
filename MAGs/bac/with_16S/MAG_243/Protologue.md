## Description of  gen. nov


Etymology:

Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome under the JAAXVQ01 of the FCPU426 phylum. 
Due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated.
No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus.


Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, the closest relative is
*Thermosinus carboxydivorans* of the Sporomusaceae family (83.17%)
with the input 16S rRNA gene being 26.19% complete compared to its closest relative.

This inconsistency is probably because of the lack of any representatives of the FCPU426 phylum on 
the All-Species Living Tree project version currently used by Protologger.



## Description of  sp. nov (MAG_243)

Etymology:

A total of 141 CAZymes were identified and starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source.
KEGG analysis predicted 
Sulfide and L-serine to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47).
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).

The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 66.11.%.
