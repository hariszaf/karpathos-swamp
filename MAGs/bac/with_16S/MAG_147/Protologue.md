## Description of *Salinibacter ..* sp. nov (MAG_147)

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similiraty, multiple species of the *Salinibacter* genus 
were among the closest relatives to it, supporting for a novel species within the genus.
*Salinibacter ruber* (95.34%) 
*Salinibacter altiplanensis* (92.95%) were those with the highest similarity scores.
POCP analysis confirmed that the genome belongs to the 
*Salinibacter* returning a value of 74.72% with it. 
GTDB-Tk supported the placement within *Salinibacter* and the generation of a novel species 
as the ANI comparison provided a value of 80.89% to *S. ruber*, confirming they are not the same species.

KEGG analysis predicted
L-glutamate production from ammonia via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-)
and
folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3).
A total of 214 CAZymes and 20 flagellar proteins were identified within the genome
and starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 65.78%.
