## Description of  fam. nov

Etymology:


The input 16S rRNA determined the isolate to be a novel family with its closest relatives 
being members of multiple families 
of the Desulfobacterota phylum but with the top hit having a similarity score of only 81.99%.
GTDB-Tk supported the creation of a novel family, placing it within the 
Hydrogenedentiales order. 


## Description of  gen. nov

Etymology:

No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus.



## Description of  sp. nov (MAG_105)

Etymology:

No valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome.
KEGG analysis predicted propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.8.3.1) and
L-glutamate production from ammonia via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
Sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47)
and sulfate assimilatory reduction to sulfide was predicted via the genome (EC:2.7.7.4, 2.7.1.25, 1.8.4.8, 1.8.1.2).
Biotin (vitamin B7) biosynthesis was predicted from pimeloyl-ACP/CoA (EC:2.3.1.47, 2.6.1.62, 6.3.3.3, 2.8.1.6).
A total of 22 flagellar proteins and 308 CAZymes were identified within the genome
and starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source.
G+C percentage is; 66.41%
