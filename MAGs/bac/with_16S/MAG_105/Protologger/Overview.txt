Genome analysis
---------------

Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as; d__Bacteria;p__Hydrogenedentota;c__Hydrogenedentia;o__Hydrogenedentiales;f__;g__;s__
GTDB-TK was unable to matched the input genome to that of a previously sequenced genome via FastANI
The genome size is; 4.35Mbp base pairs
G+C percentage is; 66.41%
Due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated.
No valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome
No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus
CRISPR arrays identified; 1
Coding sequences identified; 3571
