## Description of the ** gen. nov

Etymology:


The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity returned assignments of low scores with the best hits being members of the
Bacillaceae and the 
Desulfovibrionaceae families; in all cases the score was < 78.56%.
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as member of the UBA6099 family.
As no POCP values >50% were identified, POCP analysis supported the assignment of the genus as a novel genus 
within the UBA6099 family. 


## Description of the ** sp. nov (MAG 172)


Etymology:

KEGG analysis predicted
propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.8.3.1)
as well as 
L-glutamate production from ammonia via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
A total of 22 flagellar proteins were identified within the genome and starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source. 
225 CAZymes were identified too. 
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 57.44%.
