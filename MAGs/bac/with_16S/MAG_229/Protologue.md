## Description of  gen. nov 



Inconsistency in taxonomic assignment was observed between the 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity and the GTDB methods.

The input 16S rRNA determined the isolate to be a novel family.
with the best match being *Loriellopsis cavernicola* of the Symphyonemataceae family (NOT VALID) (86.11%).
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome under the UBA10428 family of the Bacteroidales order. 

No UBA10428 representatives are present in the All-Species Living Tree project version currently used by Protologger.

No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus. 



## Description of  sp. nov (MAG_229)

Etymology: 


KEGG analysis predicted 
Acetate production from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1)
and propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1).
Sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47).
L-glutamate production from ammonia via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-) and 
Folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3) were predicted too.

A set of 332 CAZymes was identified and starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source.

The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 39.37%.
