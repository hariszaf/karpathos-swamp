## Description of gen. nov

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, the closest relatives is
Helicobacter cetorum--Helicobacteraceae--CP003481 (Valid) (78.343949044586%)
suggesting for a novel genus. 

According to the genome based assignment via GTDB-TK however, 
genome was placed under the BM507 family supporting for a novel genus within it.

This inconsistency is probably because of the lack of any representative of the Patescibacteria phylum in the Living Tree Project (LTP) (LTPs132) version used for the 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity.

All POCP values to close relatives were below 50% suggesting for a novel genus too. 



## Description of  sp. nov (MAG_141)

The number of CAZymes identified within the type strains genome was 62. 


based on a genome completeness of 82.02% and contamination of 1.23%.

The genome size is 1.31Mbp base pairs and the G+C content of the genomic DNA is 38.79%.
