16S rRNA gene analysis
-------------------------

The input 16S rRNA determined the isolate to be; sp. nov.
The best match was to; Phaeodactylibacter xiamenensis--Lewinellaceae--JPOS01000002 (Valid) (94.67105263157895%)


Genome analysis
---------------

Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as; d__Bacteria;p__Bacteroidota;c__Bacteroidia;o__Chitinophagales;f__Saprospiraceae;g__Phaeodactylibacter;s__
GTDB-TK was unable to matched the input genome to that of a previously sequenced genome via FastANI
The genome size is; 7.06Mbp base pairs
G+C percentage is; 52.72%
Due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated.
No valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome
The input genome was assigned to Phaeodactylibacter with a POCP value of 64.94474428167565%
CRISPR arrays identified; 10
Coding sequences identified; 5541


Functional analysis
-------------------

Number of transporters; 130
