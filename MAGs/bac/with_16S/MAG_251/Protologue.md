## Description of sp. nov (MAG 251)

Etymology:


Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
the species was identified as a member of the genus *Phaeodactylibacter*  of the Lewinellaceae family, 
with its closest relatives being 
*Phaeodactylibacter xiamenensis* (94.67%) and *Phaeodactylibacter luteus* (93.18%).
This was supported by POCP values of 62.17% and 64.94% respectively. 
ANI values to each of these related species were below 95%, which was confirmed by GTDB-Tk identification as a member of the *Phaeodactylibacter* genus (GCA_009908745.1).

KEGG analysis predicted sulfide and L-serine to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47).
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-) and
folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3).
Cbb3-type cytochrome C oxidase was predicted based on the presence of sub-units I/II (ccoNO), III and IV.
Starch and cellulose were also predicted to be utilised as carbon sources.
A total of 310 CAZymes were identified within the genome. 
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 52.72%.
