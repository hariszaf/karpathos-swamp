## Description of Salinibacte  ...  sp. nov (MAG 227)

Etymology:


Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity 
multiple representatives of the 
Salisaetaceae family were found as closest relatives to the genome;
*Salisaeta longa* (92.54%),
*Longibacter salinarum*	(91.09%),
*Longimonas halophila*(90.97%), *Salinibacter ruber* (87.55%) and so on.
POCP analysis returned a value of 54.05% with *Salinibacter* genus 
and 
GTDB-TK supported the creation of a novel species within the *Salinibacter* genome
as it placed the genome as a member of the 
Salinibacteraceae family and 
due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated.


KEGG analysis predicted
L-glutamate production from ammonia via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-)
and
folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3).
A total of 225 CAZymes were identified within the genome and  starch
was predicted to be utilised as carbon source.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 60.09%.
