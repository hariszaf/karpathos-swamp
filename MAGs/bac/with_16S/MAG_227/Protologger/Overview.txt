Genome analysis
---------------

Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as; d__Bacteria;p__Bacteroidota;c__Rhodothermia;o__Rhodothermales;f__Salinibacteraceae;g__;s__
GTDB-TK was unable to matched the input genome to that of a previously sequenced genome via FastANI
The genome size is; 4.33Mbp base pairs
G+C percentage is; 60.09%
Due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated.
No valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome
The input genome was assigned to Salinibacter with a POCP value of 54.05125166641979%
CRISPR arrays identified; 10
Coding sequences identified; 3715


Functional analysis
-------------------
