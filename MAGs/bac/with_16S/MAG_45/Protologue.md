## Description of ** gen. nov
<!-- Genome completeness is ;64.85
Genome contamination is ;2.01 -->
Etymology:

16S rRNA gene sequence similarity returned members of the Geodermatophilaceae family as the closest relatives
with a rather low score (75.24%). 
No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus. 
GTDB-Tk assigned the isolate to Chazhemtobacteraceae family, a family that currently has a single genome on GTDB. 


## Description of ** sp. nov (MAG 45)

Etymology:


A total of 75 CAZymes were identified.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 42.39%.
