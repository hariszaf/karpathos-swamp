Quality check
-------------

The input 16S rRNA gene is acceptable at 94.23446508648303% complete compared to its closest relative
The input 16S rRNA gene was not identified as a chimera.
WARNING: The input genome is incomplete (64.85%), please check the genome and be wary of the output results as they may be altered due to missing genomic regions
Genome completeness is ;64.85
Genome contamination is ;2.01


16S rRNA gene analysis
-------------------------

The input 16S rRNA determined the isolate to be; fam. nov.
The best match was to; Geodermatophilus daqingensis--Geodermatophilaceae--KX881378 (Valid) (75.2400548696845%)


Genome analysis
---------------

Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as; d__Bacteria;p__Patescibacteria;c__Microgenomatia;o__UBA1400;f__Chazhemtobacteraceae;g__;s__
GTDB-TK was unable to matched the input genome to that of a previously sequenced genome via FastANI
The genome size is; 1.6Mbp base pairs
G+C percentage is; 42.39%
Due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated.
No valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome
No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus
CRISPR arrays identified; 1
Coding sequences identified; 1698
