## Description of the ** gen. nov. (the same genus with MAG 142)
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;91.46
Genome contamination is ;1.3
 -->

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
its closest relative are 
*Magnetospira thiophila* of the Thalassospiraceae family 
with a similarity score of 88.43% 
and 
*Roseospirillum parvum* of the Rhodospirillaceae
with a score of 88.37%, suggesting a novel genus.
POCP analysis confirmed that it represents a distinct genus; a POCP value of 30.63% with *R. parvum*.
GTDB-Tk supported further the creation of a novel genus 
by placing it  within the Micavibrionaceae family. 
A set of the MAGs retrieved in our study, had the exact same placement by the GTDB-Tk
(MAGs: 142, 18, 113, 76, 276). 

As described in the protologue of MAG 142, both MAG 42 and MAG 18 are representatives
of the same novel genus. 


## Description of sp. 

Etymology:

Based on KEGG analysis
sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47) 
and
folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis was predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3).
A total of 113 CAZymes and 20 flagellar proteins were identified within the genome.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 46.5%.
