Quality check
-------------

The input 16S rRNA gene is acceptable at 90.42682926829268% complete compared to its closest relative
The input 16S rRNA gene was not identified as a chimera.
WARNING: The input genome is incomplete (72.22%), please check the genome and be wary of the output results as they may be altered due to missing genomic regions
Genome completeness is ;72.22
Genome contamination is ;1.85


16S rRNA gene analysis
-------------------------

The input 16S rRNA determined the isolate to be; fam. nov.
The best match was to; Oerskovia turbata--Promicromonosporaceae--X79454 (Valid) (78.11012916383413%)


Genome analysis
---------------

Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as; d__Bacteria;p__Patescibacteria;c__Gracilibacteria;o__CAIRYL01;f__;g__;s__
GTDB-TK was unable to matched the input genome to that of a previously sequenced genome via FastANI
The genome size is; 1.55Mbp base pairs
G+C percentage is; 56.99%
Due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated.
No valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome
No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus
CRISPR arrays identified; 0
Coding sequences identified; 1489
