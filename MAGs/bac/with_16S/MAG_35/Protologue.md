## Description of Candidatus  fam. nov

<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;72.22
Genome contamination is ;1.85
 -->

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity 
its closest relatives had a score of <78% and no POCP values >50% were identified.
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed it within the 
CAIRYL01
of the Patescibacteria phylum, supporting for the creation of a novel family.
