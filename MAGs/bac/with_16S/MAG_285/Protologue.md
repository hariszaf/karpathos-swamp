## Description of gen. nov

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
members of the
Anaeromyxobacteraceae and 
Vulgatibacteraceae families are among its 
closest relatives with *Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans*
having a top hit of 87.37% suggesting for the creation of a novel genus. 
POCP analysis confirmed it represents a novel genus as 
all its relatives had POCP values of <50%; indicatively, *A. dehalogenans* had a POCP of 23.84%.
GTDB-Tk supported further the creation of a novel genus, placing it 
within the XYA12-FULL-58-9 family of the Myxococcota phylum. 


## Description of sp. nov (MAG 285)

Etymology:


KEGG analysis predicted 
sulfate assimilatory reduction to sulfide via the genome (EC:2.7.7.4, 2.7.1.25, 1.8.4.8, 1.8.7.1),
L-glutamate production from ammonia via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-)
and folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3).
A total of 214 CAZymes and 21 flagellar proteins were identified within the genome, 
while 
starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source. 
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 63.06%.
