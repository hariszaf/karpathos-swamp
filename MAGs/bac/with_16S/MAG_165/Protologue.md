## Description of the ** fam. nov 

Etymology:


Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, its closest relatives are members of the Acidimicrobiaceae family 
*Acidiferrimicrobium australe* (84.46%) and
*Acidimicrobium ferrooxidans* (84.36%) suggesting for a novel family. 
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as a member of the UBA5794 order of the Acidimicrobiia class
supporting further that the strain represents a novel family.


ANI identified the input genome as novel, with the best match being to *Marmoricola aurantiacus* with a value of 75.29% of the Propionibacteriales order 
and had an equivalent hit (74.89%) with the *Saccharothrix syringae* Mycobacteriales order.
<!-- This could be a sign of a novel order within the c__Actinomycetia class? -->

## Description of the ** gen. nov 

Etymology:

## Description of the ** sp. nov (MAG 165)

Etymology:

KEGG analysis predicted 
L-glutamate production from ammonia via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
A total of 91 CAZymes were identified and 
starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source.


The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 71.39%.
