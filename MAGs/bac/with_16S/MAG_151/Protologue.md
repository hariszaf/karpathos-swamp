## Description of fam. nov

Etymology:


Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity its closest relatives 
are members of the Halanaerobiaceae family with 
*Halanaerobium praevalens* being the top hit with a score of 85.50%, suggesting for a novel family.
GTDB-Tk supported the creation of a novel family, placing it as a member of the Halanaerobiales order. 


## Description of gen. nov

Etymology:

No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus.


## Description of sp. nov (MAG_151)

Etymology:

Due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated.
KEGG analysis predicted 
acetate production from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1) and 
butyrate production from butanoyl-CoA (EC:2.8.3.8) and (EC:2.3.1.19, 2.7.2.7)
Propionate production was predicted from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1)
and cobalamin (vitamin B12) biosynthesis was predicted from cobinamide (EC:2.5.1.17, 6.3.5.10, 6.2.1.10, 2.7.1.156).
Further functional analysis, identified a total of 17  flagellar proteins and 79 CAZymes
were identified within the genome
and starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 29.89%.
