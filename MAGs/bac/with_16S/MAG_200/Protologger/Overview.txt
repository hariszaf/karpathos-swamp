16S rRNA gene analysis
-------------------------

The input 16S rRNA determined the isolate to be; gen. nov.
The best match was to; Owenweeksia hongkongensis--Schleiferiaceae--AB125062 (Valid) (90.70904645476773%)


Genome analysis
---------------

Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as; d__Bacteria;p__Bacteroidota;c__Bacteroidia;o__Flavobacteriales;f__Schleiferiaceae;g__Owenweeksia;s__
GTDB-TK was unable to matched the input genome to that of a previously sequenced genome via FastANI
The genome size is; 2.57Mbp base pairs
G+C percentage is; 48.6%
Due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated.
No valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome
No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus
CRISPR arrays identified; 1
Coding sequences identified; 2333


Functional analysis
-------------------

Number of transporters; 68
Number of secretion genes; 13
Number of unique enzymes; 471
The following carbon sources were predicted to be utilised; 
Acetate production predicted from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1)
