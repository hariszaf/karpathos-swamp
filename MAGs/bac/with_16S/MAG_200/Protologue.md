## Description of ... nov. sp (MAG_200)


Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, the closest relatives is
*Owenweeksia hongkongensis*--Schleiferiaceae--AB125062 (Valid) (90.70%)
suggesting the isolate to be a novel genus.

Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as *Owenweeksia*
and it was unable to matched the input genome to that of a previously sequenced genome via FastANI
supporting for the presence of a novel genus too.

Consistent with that, no POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus.


KEGG analysis predicted 
Acetate production from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1),
and 
Propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1).

Folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis was also predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3).




The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 48.6%.
