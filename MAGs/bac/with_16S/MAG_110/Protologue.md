# Description of sp. nov (MAG  110)

<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;97.66
Genome contamination is ;2.27
 -->
Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA sequence similarity 
its closest relative is 
*Bacillus taeanensis* of the Bacillaceae family with a score of	76.93%.
POCP analysis returned no values >50% with any of its closest relatives confirming it 
represents a distinct genus.
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as; 
SM23-32 family of the Planctomycetota phylum.
suggesting the creation of a novel genus.

Based on GTDB-Tkcc had the exact same placement, 
supporting a novel genus. 
All their paired combinations ANI values were calculated to 
confirm they represent distinct species; 
MAG 20 - MAG : 79.003
MAG 20 - MAG192: 76.7193
all the rest pairs had an ANI <75%.
To identify if they represent 1 or more genera further analysis is required. 


## Description ** sp. nov (MAG 255)

Based on KEGG analysis, 
sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47).
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
Biotin (vitamin B7) biosynthesis predicted from pimeloyl-ACP/CoA (EC:2.3.1.47, 2.6.1.62, 6.3.3.3, 2.8.1.6).
Cobalamin (vitamin B12) biosynthesis predicted from cobinamide (EC:2.5.1.17, 6.3.5.10, 6.2.1.10, 2.7.1.156) and
Riboflavin (vitamin B2) biosynthesis predicted from GTP (EC:3.5.4.25, 3.5.4.26, 1.1.1.193, 3.1.3.104, 4.1.99.12, 2.5.1.78, 2.5.1.9, 2.7.1.26, 2.7.7.2).
A total of 442 CAZymes and 20 flagellar proteins were identified within the genome, while starch
was predicted to be utilised as carbon source. 
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 67.63%.
