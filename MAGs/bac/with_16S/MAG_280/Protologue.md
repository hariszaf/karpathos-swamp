## Description of  **  gen. nov 
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;89.09
Genome contamination is ;2.27
 -->

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity 
its closest relatives 
are representatives of multiple families of various phyla
with 
*Desulfonauticus autotrophicus* having the highest similarity score of 82.22%. 
GTDB-Tk placed it within the Sediminispirochaetaceae family of 
Spirochaetota, supporting it represents a novel genus.
POCP analysis with its closest relatives had no POCP values >50% for any of them


## Description of  **  sp. nov (MAG 280) 

Etymology: 


KEGG analysis predicted
acetate production from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1)
and
propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1).
Sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47)
A total of 23 flagellar proteins and 157 CAZymes were identified within the genome;
while starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source. 
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 51.68%.
