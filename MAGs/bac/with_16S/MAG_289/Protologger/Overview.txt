Genome analysis
---------------

Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as; d__Bacteria;p__Gemmatimonadota;c__Gemmatimonadetes;o__KS3-K002;f__JABDQB01;g__;s__
GTDB-TK was unable to matched the input genome to that of a previously sequenced genome via FastANI
The genome size is; 3.61Mbp base pairs
G+C percentage is; 73.6%
ANI identified the input genome as novel, with the best match being to Anaeromyxobacter_dehalogenans with a value of 74.9525%
No valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome
No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus
