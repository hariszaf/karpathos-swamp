## Description of gen. nov

<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;94.11
Genome contamination is ;3.85
 -->
 
Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequenec similarity 
members of multiple families from various phyla
were predicted among the 
its closest relatives with a top hit of 80.87%.
No POCP values >50% were identified.
GTDB-Tk assigned it within the 
JABDQB01 family 
of the 
Gemmatimonadetes class supporting for the creation of a novel genus.  

## Description of sp. nov (MAG 289)

Etymology:

KEGG analysis predicted 
folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3).
A total of 192 CAZymes were identified within the genome 
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 73.6%.
