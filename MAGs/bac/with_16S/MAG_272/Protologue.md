## Description of ** gen. nov 

<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;97.07
Genome contamination is ;1.69
 -->

Etymology:

The best match was to; *Ruficoccus amylovorans*
of the Puniceicoccaceae family with a similarity score of 90.68% 
suggesting it represents a novel genus. 
POCP analysis confirmed it is a distinct genus; a value of 38.27
was returned for the case of *R. amylovorans*. 
GTDB-Tk supported further its assignment within a novel genus by placing it 
within the
KCTC-12870 family of the Opitutales order; the order of Puniceicoccaceae.

## Description of ** sp. nov (MAG 272)

Etymology:


Acetate production predicted from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1)
Propionate production predicted from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1)
Sulfide and L-serine are predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47)
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-)
Folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3)
Cbb3-type cytochrome C oxidase was predicted based on the presence of sub-units I/II (ccoNO), III and IV
A total of 158 CAZymes were identified within the genome
and starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source. 
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 63.51%.
