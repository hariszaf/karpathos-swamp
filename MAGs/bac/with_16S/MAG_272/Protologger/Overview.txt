16S rRNA gene analysis
-------------------------

The input 16S rRNA determined the isolate to be; gen. nov.
The best match was to; Ruficoccus amylovorans--Puniceicoccaceae--KT751307 (Valid) (90.6801007556675%)


Genome analysis
---------------

Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as; d__Bacteria;p__Verrucomicrobiota;c__Verrucomicrobiae;o__Opitutales;f__KCTC-12870;g__;s__
GTDB-TK was unable to matched the input genome to that of a previously sequenced genome via FastANI
The genome size is; 3.12Mbp base pairs
G+C percentage is; 63.51%
Due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated.
No valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome
No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus
CRISPR arrays identified; 3
Coding sequences identified; 2818


Functional analysis
-------------------

Number of transporters; 81
Number of secretion genes; 28
Number of unique enzymes; 585
The following carbon sources were predicted to be utilised; starch
Acetate production predicted from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1)
Propionate production predicted from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1)
Sulfide and L-serine are predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47)
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-)
Folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3)
Cbb3-type cytochrome C oxidase was predicted based on the presence of sub-units I/II (ccoNO), III and IV
