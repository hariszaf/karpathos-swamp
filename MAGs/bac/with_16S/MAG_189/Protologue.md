## Description of the *Erythrobacter   xxxx* sp. nov (MAG_189)
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;98.79
Genome contamination is ;1.02
 -->
Etymology: 


Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
its closest relatives are members of the Erythrobacteraceae family
*Erythrobacter litoralis* with a similarity score of 97.80%, 
*Altererythrobacter insulae* with 97.32%,
suggesting it represents a novel species. 
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome within
*Erythrobacter* genus supporting the creation of a novel species too, 
as ANI had a top hit  79.3074% with *A. xiamenensis*.

KEGG analysis predicted
sulfate assimilatory reduction to sulfide via the genome (EC:2.7.7.4, 2.7.1.25, 1.8.4.8, 1.8.1.2)
and 
L-glutamate production from ammonia via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
Sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47).
Folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis was predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3)
and Cbb3-type cytochrome C oxidase was predicted based on the presence of sub-units I, II, III and IV.
Anoxygenic photosystem II was predicted from the genome (pufL, pufM).
A total of 20 flagellar proteins and 118 CAZymes were identified within the genome.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 66.59%.
