## Description of  gen. nov

Etymology: 

The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity suggested members of the Erythrobacteraceae family 
as the closest relatives to the genome but with a score of only 87.94%. 
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome under the UBA6503 family of the Alphaproteobacteria class. 
No valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome.
The assignment as a novel genus was also supproted by the POCP analysis
as no POCP values >50% were identified. 


## Description of  sp. nov (MAG 47)

Etymology: 


A total of 60 CAZymes were identified as well as 21 flagellar proteins.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 53.16%.
