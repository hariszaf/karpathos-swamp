## Description of the ** gen. nov 

Etymology:


Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis its closest relatives are members of the 
Dehalococcoidaceae family (83.83%) 
GTDB-Tk supported the creation of a novel genus, placing strain within the AB-539-J10 family of the 
Dehalococcoidia class.
POCP analysis confirmed that strain represents a distinct genus as no POCP values >50% were identified 
with any close relative.


## Description of the ** sp. nov (MAG 174)

Etymology:


KEGG analysis predicted
L-glutamate production from ammonia via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
A total of 48 CAZymes were identified and 
starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source. 

The G+C content of the genomic DNA is is 58.09%.
