## Description of ** gen. nov

<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;98.91
Genome contamination is ;2.25
 -->

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
multiple members of the Caryophanales incertae sedis family 
are among its closest relatives with a score of 79.72%.
POCP analysis supported it is a distinct genus as 
no POCP values >50% with any of its relatives was found. 
GTDB-Tk supported the placement within Marinilabiliaceae family 
(of the Bacteroidota phylum)
and the generation of a novel genus.

## Description of ** sp. nov (MAG 283)

KEGG analysis predicted
acetate production from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1),
butyrate production from butanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.19, 2.7.2.7)
and
propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1).
Sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47)
and
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
Moreover,
cobalamin (vitamin B12) biosynthesis was predicted from cobinamide (EC:2.5.1.17, 6.3.5.10, 6.2.1.10, 2.7.1.156)
and 
folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3).
A total of 449 CAZymes were identified within the genome and 
starch and cellulose
were predicted to be utilised as carbon sources. 
The G+C content of tehe genomic DNA is 44.04%.
