## Description of  gen. nov

Etymology:

The species was identified as a member of the genus 
*Pontibacter roseus*--Hymenobacteraceae--ARDO01000013 (Valid) 
based on 
16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 84.43%
suggesting for a novel family.
The input 16S rRNA gene is acceptable at 93.08% complete compared to *Pontibacter roseus*.

However, genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome under the DT-110 genus of the 
Saprospiraceae family. 

Both the Hymenobacteraceae and the Saprospiraceae families are present on both the All-Species Living Tree project version currently used by Protologger
and GTDB.

As genome completeness is 100.0% and contamination is 1.77% the genome based assignmed was selected.


## Description of  sp. nov (MAG 224)

Etymology:


KEGG analysis predicted sulfide and L-serine to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47). 
On top of that, L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-)
amd folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3).

298 CAZymes identified within the genome of strains of this species. 
Starch was uniquely predicted as a carbon source.
