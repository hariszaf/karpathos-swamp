## Description of DT-110 ... sp. nov (MAG 224)

Etymology:

The species was identified as a member of the genus 
Hymenobacteraceae family based on 
16S rRNA gene sequence similarity; the top hit had a score of 84.43% - *Pontibacter roseus*.
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome under the DT-110 genus of the  Saprospiraceae family
suggesting the genome representing a novel species.
POCP analysis confirmed that as no POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus.
As MAGs 144, 224 and 228 of the present study had the exact same GTDB-Tk assignment, 
ANI values of among them were calcualted and a value of 77.61% between 
MAG 228 and MAG 224 confirmed that they are distinct species. 
The ANI value between MAG 224 and 214 was <50%.

KEGG analysis predicted sulfide and L-serine to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47). 
On top of that, L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-)
amd folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3).

298 CAZymes identified within the genome of strains of this species. 
Starch was uniquely predicted as a carbon source.
