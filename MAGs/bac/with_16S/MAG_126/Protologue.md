## Description of gen. nov

Etymology:


Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
the species was identified as a member of the genus *Catalinimonas* of the Catalimonadaceae family,
suggesting that the genome represents a nove species of the family. 
*Catalinimonas alkaloidigena* (96.14%)
*Catalinimonas niigatensis* (95.66%) were its the closest relatives.
However, no POCP values >50% were identified, with any of the closest relatives,
indicating the input genome represents a novel genus.
*Catalinimonas alkaloidigena* had a POCP value of	35.59%.
GTDB-Tk supported the placement of the genome within a novel genus assigning it 
as a member of the Cyclobacteriaceae family.


## Description of sp. nov  (MAG_126)

Etymology:


KEGG analysis predicted 
acetate production predicted from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1)
and
propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1).
Sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47)
In addition,
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-)
and folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3).
A total of 381 CAZymes were identified within the genome while starch and cellulose
were predicted to be utilised as carbon sources.
