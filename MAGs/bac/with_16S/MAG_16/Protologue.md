## Description of .. gen. nov 

Etymology: 

Inconsistency between the 
16S rRNA gene sequence similarity and the GTDB-Tk assignment was observed. 
According to the prime, the closest relative is 
*Thiohalocapsa marina*--Chromatiaceae--AM491592 (Valid) (82.60%)
while 
genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome under the 
MVZB01 family of the Sumerlaeota phylum. 
This inconsistency is probably due to the lack of any representative of the 
Sumerlaeota phylum on the All-Species Living Tree project version currently used by Protologger.

Contrary, the Chromatiaceae family is present on GTDB. 

No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus


## Description of .. sp. nov (MAG_16)


Etymology: 


A set of flagellar proteins (*n*=23) were identified within the genome. 

Sulfide and L-serine are predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47)
and L-glutamate production from ammonia via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).

The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 61.91%.
