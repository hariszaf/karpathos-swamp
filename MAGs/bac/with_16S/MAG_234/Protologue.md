## Description of   ord. nov
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;97.3
Genome contamination is ;3.01

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
its closest relatives are members of the 
Marinilabiliaceae family with the top hit 
having a score of 92.32%, suggesting it represents a novel genus. 

However, genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome
within the Lentisphaeria class, suggesting it represents a novel order. 

MAG 234 and 153 had the exact same placement. 
To investigate their relationship several tests were performed.

Etymology:

Based on the ANI value between MAG 234 and 153 (80.216) they represent distinct species. 
KEGG analysis predicted
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
Sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47).
A total of 247 CAZymes were identified within the genome while 
starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source.
