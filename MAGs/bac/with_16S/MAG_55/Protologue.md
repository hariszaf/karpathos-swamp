## Description of gen. nov

Etymology:

The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity supported that the closest relatives to the genome
are members of the Spirochaetaceae family, with a best hit of 88.34% (*Alkalispirochaeta odontotermitis*), 
indicating the presence of a novel genus within the family. 
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome under the PXBQ01 family of the Spirochaetales C order.
No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus too. 


## Description of sp. nov (MAG 55)

Etymology:

KEGG analysis predicted acetate production from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1),
butyrate production from butanoyl-CoA (EC:2.8.3.8)
and propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1).
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-) too.
Sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47). 
A total of 21 flagellar proteins were identified within the genome as well as 153 CAZymes.
Starch was predicted to be utilised as a carbon source.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 59.21%.
