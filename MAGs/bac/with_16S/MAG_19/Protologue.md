## Description of the ** fam. nov

Etymology: 

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, 
members of Chromatiaceae, Ectothiorhodospiraceae and Microbulbiferaceae families  
of the Gammaproteobacteria class, 
were among its closest relatives; *Thiohalocapsa marina* had a top similarity score of 80.73%,
suggesting for the creation of a novel family. 
GTDB-Tk supported the creation of a novel family placing it within the 
SURF-12 order.

## Description of the ** sp. nov (MAG 109)

Etymology:

KEGG analysis predicted
acetate production from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1) and
propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1).
Sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47),
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-)
and Biotin (vitamin B7) biosynthesis was predicted from pimeloyl-ACP/CoA (EC:2.3.1.47, 2.6.1.62, 6.3.3.3, 2.8.1.6).
A total of 23 flagellar proteins and 368 CAZymes were identified with the genome
while starch and cellulose were predicted to be utilised as carbon sources.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 55.35%.
