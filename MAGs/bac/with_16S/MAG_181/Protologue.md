## Description of Salinivenus ... sp. nov  (MAG_201)

Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
multiple representatives of the Salinibacteraceae family 
were found among its closest relatives, suggesting that the genome represents a novel species.
Among them, *Salinivenus lutea* had a similarity score of	81.70%. 
POCP analysis returned a value of 54.06%  between the genome and the 
*Salinivenus* genus indicating that the genome is part of it. 
GTDB-Tk supported the creation of a novel species, placing 
the genome under the JAAAPH01 genus of the Salinibacteraceae family,
with no ANI values calculated
due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives.
The ANI value between the genome and MAG 181 that were placed with the exact same taxonomy
by the GTDB-Tk was 81.20 confirming that they are distinct species. 

KEGG analysis predicted 
L-glutamate production from ammonia via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-)
and folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3).
A total of 299 CAZymes and 21 flagellar proteins were identified within the genome, 
while starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon resource.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 62.32%.
