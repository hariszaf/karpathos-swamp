## Description of fam. nov 


Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity
the best match was Ferruginivarius sediminum--Rhodospirillaceae--KY489984--NOT VALID (82.67%) suggesting a novel family
within the Rhodospirillales order;
the 16S rRNA gene was determined to be 60.32% complete compared to it. 

The GTDB-Tk assignment supported the presence of a novel family too, but within the UBA1280 order instead.
The genome completeness was 87.11% and the contamination 0.0%. 
The UBA1280 order has currently only 19 genomes and this is probably the reason why the 16S analysis 
suggested otherwise. 
No representative of the UBA1280 order is present on the All-Species Living Tree project version currently used by Protologger.

## Description of sp. nov  (MAG_139)

Etymology: 

Functional analysis identified multiple flagellar proteins(FlhA, FlhB, FlgB, FlgC, FlgD, FlgE, FlgG, FlgH, FlgI, FlgJ, FlgK, FlgL, FliC, FliD, FliE, FliF, FliG, FliK, FliM, FliN, MotA).
59 CAZymes were identified too. 
The genome size is 1.31Mbp base pairs and the G+C content of the genomic DNA is 51.88%.
