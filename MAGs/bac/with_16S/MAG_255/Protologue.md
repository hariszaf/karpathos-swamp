## Description ** gen. nov

<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;97.73
Genome contamination is ;1.14
 -->
Etymology:

Based on 16S rRNA sequence similarity 
its closest relative is 
*Anaerohalosphaera lusitana* of the Anaerohalosphaeraceae family with a score of	80.20%.
POCP analysis returned no values >50% with any of its closest relatives confirming it 
represents a distinct genus.
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as; 
SM23-33 family of the Planctomycetota phylum suggesting the creation of a novel genus.
MAG 264 had the exact same placement with MAG 255. 
Their ANI value (77.31%) confirmed they are distinct species. 
To identify if they represent 1 or 2 genera furthere analysis is required. 

## Description ** sp. nov (MAG 255)

Based on KEGG analysis, 
sulfide and L-serine are predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47).
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
A total of 188 CAZymes and 19 flagellar proteins were identified within the genome,
while starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 68.47%.
