## Description of *Alkalispirochaeta <species name>* sp. nov  (MAG_123)

Etymology:
  
Inconsistency in taxonomic assignment was observed between methods as the highest match based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity was Phaeodactylibacter xiamenensis--Lewinellaceae--JPOS01000002 (Valid) (84.10%)
and GTDB assignment was to the Alkalispirochaeta genus.
Genome completeness was 100.0 and contamination 0.53 
while the 16S rRNA gene was determined to be 77.29% complete compared to its closest relative.
Therefore, the genome based assignment was followed. 


KEGG analysis predicted acetate production from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1) and 
propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1). 
Sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47)
and L-glutamate production from ammonia, via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
A total of 142 CAZymes and 21 flagellar proteins were identified within genome.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 59.69%.
