## Description of *Alkalispirochaeta <species name>* sp. nov  (MAG_123)



Inconsistency in taxonomic assignment was observed between methods as the highest match based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity was Phaeodactylibacter xiamenensis--Lewinellaceae--JPOS01000002 (Valid) (84.10%)
and GTDB assignment was to the Alkalispirochaeta genus.
Genome completeness was 100.0 and contamination 0.53 
while the 16S rRNA gene was determined to be 77.29% complete compared to its closest relative.
Therefore, the genome based assignment was followed. 


The number of CAZymes identified within the type strains genome was 142. 

KEGG analysis predicted acetate production from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1) and 
propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1).
Functional analysis identified multiple flagellar proteins 
(FlhA, FlhB, FlgB, FlgC, FlgD, FlgE, FlgF, FlgG, FlgJ, FlgK, FlgL, FliC, FliD, FliE, FliF, FliG, FliK, FliM, FliN, MotA, MotB).
Sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47)
and L-glutamate production from ammonia, via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).

The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 59.69%.
