16S rRNA gene analysis
-------------------------

The input 16S rRNA determined the isolate to be; fam. nov.
The best match was to; Phaeodactylibacter xiamenensis--Lewinellaceae--JPOS01000002 (Valid) (84.10174880763115%)


Genome analysis
---------------

Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as; d__Bacteria;p__Spirochaetota;c__Spirochaetia;o__Spirochaetales_C;f__Alkalispirochaetaceae;g__Alkalispirochaeta;s__
GTDB-TK was unable to matched the input genome to that of a previously sequenced genome via FastANI
The genome size is; 3.45Mbp base pairs
G+C percentage is; 59.69%
Due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated.
No valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome
No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus
CRISPR arrays identified; 0
Coding sequences identified; 3212
