## Description of  gen. nov
<!-- 
Genome completeness is ;77.06
Genome contamination is ;1.1
 -->

Etymology:

The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity returned 
relatives with especially low scores; 
*Hippea alviniae* of the Desulfurellaceae family with a score of 82.03% was the top hit. 
GTDB-Tk placed it within the QNDG01 family of the homonymous phylum 
suggesting the creation of a novel genus.

## Description of  sp. nov (MAG 77)

Etymology:

KEGG analysis predicted
acetate production from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1) and
propionate production predicted from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1).
A total of 126 CAZymes were identified within the genome and  starch and cellulose
were predicted to be utilised as carbon sources.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 48.62%.
