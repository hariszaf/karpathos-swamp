WARNING: The input 16S rRNA gene may be incomplete, please check the 16S rRNA gene and be wary of the output results as they may be incorrect
The input 16S rRNA gene was determined to be 37.111517367458866% complete compared to its closest relative
The input 16S rRNA gene was not identified as a chimera.
WARNING: The input genome is incomplete (77.06%), please check the genome and be wary of the output results as they may be altered due to missing genomic regions
Genome completeness is ;77.06
Genome contamination is ;1.1


16S rRNA gene analysis
-------------------------

The input 16S rRNA determined the isolate to be; fam. nov.
The best match was to; Hippea alviniae--Desulfurellaceae--FR754500 (Valid) (82.03389830508473%)


Genome analysis
---------------

Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome as; d__Bacteria;p__QNDG01;c__QNDG01;o__QNDG01;f__QNDG01;g__;s__
GTDB-TK was unable to matched the input genome to that of a previously sequenced genome via FastANI
The genome size is; 2.59Mbp base pairs
G+C percentage is; 48.62%
Due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated.
No valid species with a sequenced genome within the GTDB-TK database was identified to have a ANI value >95% with the studied genome
No POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus
CRISPR arrays identified; 0
Coding sequences identified; 2115


Functional analysis
-------------------

Number of transporters; 73
Number of secretion genes; 28
Number of unique enzymes; 477
The following carbon sources were predicted to be utilised; starch, cellulose
Acetate production predicted from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1)
