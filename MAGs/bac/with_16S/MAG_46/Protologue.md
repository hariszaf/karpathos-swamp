## Description of      gen. nov

Etymology: 

The 16s rRNA gene sequence similarity 
returned members of the Clostridiaceae family as the closest relatives but with a low score (81.69%). 
Genome based assignment via GTDB-TK placed the genome under the JAABVY01 genus
of the Zixibacteria phylum. 
Due to the low similarity of the input genome to its closest relatives, no ANI values were able to be calculated 
supporting for the presence of a novel genus.
POCP analysis confirmed that
as no POCP values >50% were identified, indicating the input genome represents a novel genus.


## Description of      sp. nov (MAG 46)

Etymology: 

KEGG analysis predicted 
Sulfide and L-serine to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47).
L-glutamate production from ammonia was predicted via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
Several flagellar proteins (*n*=22) were identified within the genome
and starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source.
A total of 186 CAZymes were identified too. 
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 47.12%.
