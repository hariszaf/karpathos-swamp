## Description of  gen. nov

Etymology: 

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, representatives of multiple families were returned as closest relatives
with 
*Caldithrix palaeochoryensis* of the Calditrichaceae family having the highest similarity score of 84.04%.
The 16S rRNA gene analysis suggested the creation of a novel family to place MAG 38 
however, 
GTDB-Tk suggested the creation of a novel genus within the Fermentibacteraceae family.
POCP analysis confirmed that it consists a distinct genus as 
no POCP values >50% were identified with any of its close relatives.

MAGs 38 and 277 had the exact same assignment by GTDB-Tk 
suggesting novel genera of the 
Fermentibacteraceae family. 
To make sure they are not representatives of the same species, their ANI values was calculated and found 81.24%. 
To make sure whether they represent 1 or 2 genera.... 


## Description of  sp. nov (MAG 38)

Etymology: 

KEGG analysis predicted
L-glutamate production from ammonia via L-glutamine (EC:6.3.1.2, 1.4.1.-).
A total of 143 CAZymes were identified within the genome and starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source.
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 65.02%.
