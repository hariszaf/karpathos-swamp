## Description of  gen. nov

Etymology: 

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, 
its closest relatives are 
*Cerasicoccus arenae* with a score of 88.06%
*Ruficoccus amylovorans* with 88.0%; both members of the Puniceicoccaceae family,
suggesting it represents a novel genus. 
POCP analysis confirmed that it is a distinct genus; with a POCP value of 31.04 with 
*R. amylovorans* being the highest among its relatives. 
Genome based assignment via GTDB-Tk further supported the creation of a novel genus 
by placing it within the 
JABSRG01 family of the 
Opitutales order; Puniceicoccaceae is part of this order. 
MAGs 215 and 100 that had the exact same assignment by GTDB-Tk had a ANI value <50% 
indicating they are distinct species. 

## Description of  sp. nov (MAG_100)

Etymology: 

KEGG analysis predicted
acetate production from acetyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1) and
propionate production from propanoyl-CoA (EC:2.3.1.8, 2.7.2.1).
Sulfide and L-serine were predicted to be utilised to produce L-cysteine and acetate (EC:2.3.1.30, 2.5.1.47)
and
folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis was predicted from 7,8-dihydrofolate (EC:1.5.1.3).
Cbb3-type cytochrome C oxidase was predicted based on the presence of sub-units I/II (ccoNO), III and IV.
A total of 18 flagellar proteins and 236 CAZymes were identified within the genome
while starch was predicted to be utilised as carbon source. 
The G+C content of the genomic DNA is 58.44%.
